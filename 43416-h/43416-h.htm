<p class="center p2">ALTAR OF THE LARES.</p>

<p>In the month of August 1888, on the Via Arenula, the new street
leading to the new Ponte Garibaldi, at the corner of the Via di S.
Bartolomeo dei Vaccinari, the last street on the right which leads up
to the reputed House and School of S. Paul, at the depth of twenty-seven
feet (which shows how the soil has accumulated here), another
of the Lares Compitales of the time of Augustus was discovered. It
is a square marble altar with a beautiful cornice, which is, unfortunately,
broken. On the front is a relief representing four men at a
sacrifice, with bay crowns upon their veiled heads. A bull and a pig
are by assistants being led up to sacrifice&mdash;the bull to the Genius
Cæsarum, and the pig to the Lares. On each side of the altar is the
figure of a youth, the titular deities; and at the back a crown.</p>

<p>Above the relief in front is the inscription,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
LARIBVS . AVGVSTIS<br />
CIVS . C. M<br />
MANIVS C. <i>l. iu</i>STVS<br />
MAG. VICI ANNI . NONI</p>
</div>

<p>It was dedicated to the Lares of Augustus by four officials of a street
nine years after Augustus had restored the street shrines. That was
in 6 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> (Dion Cassius, lv. 8); so this altar was erected in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 3.</p>

<p>On the right side under the cornice is inscribed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
P . CLODIVS . P</p>
</div>
<p>and on the left side,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
S . L . L . SALVIVS .</p>
</div>
<p>evidently the names of two of the officials.</p>

<p>The altar stands on a travertine base, on which is written,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
<i>ma</i><span class="smcap">GISTRI</span> . <span class="smcap">VICI</span> . <span class="smcap">ÆSCLETI</span> . <span class="smcap">ANNI</span> . <span class="smcap">VIIII</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>which is valuable as giving us the name of the street Vicus Æscletus,
Beech Street.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This is the first mention we have of this street. The victors of the
Pythian games were crowned with a chaplet made of beech leaves
before the bay (laurel) was used; hence Ovid,&mdash;</p>

<p>Suetonius ("Augustus," xxx.) says, "He divided the city into
regions and streets, ordaining that the annual magistrates should
take by lot the charge of the former, and that the latter should be
superintended by wardens chosen out of the people of each neighbourhood."
Pliny ("N. H.," iii. 9) says, "The city is divided into
fourteen regions, with two hundred and sixty-five cross streets under
the guardianship of the Lares."</p>

<p>The pedestal of the Apollo, leader of the Muses (No. 516), in the
Vatican Museum, is an altar dedicated to the Laribus Augustis,
Genius Cæsarum, by four street officials; on the left of which is the
Genius of Augustus, similar to the statue, 555, in the Sala Rotonda.</p>

<p>If the Jewish tradition is correct, that the House of S. Paul was
at the angle of the Via S. Bartolomeo dei Vaccinari and the Via
degli Strengari; and if the Romish Church tradition is true, that he
had a school (room shown) at the Church of S. Paola alla Regola, on
the Via S. Paola alla Regola, a continuation of the Via S. Bartolomeo
dei Vaccinari; then we have at last arrived at the name of the street
where the apostle dwelt for two whole years in his own hired house,
62 to 64,&mdash;namely, the Vicus Æscletus, probably so called because it
led to a grove of beech trees, Æsculus being corrupted into Æscletus.</p>

<p>Pliny (xvi. 15) speaks of this grove: "Q. Hortensius, the dictator,
on the secession of the plebeians to the Janiculum (<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 466), passed
a law in the Æsculetum, that what the plebeians had enacted should

<p>The Government is forming in the old monastery, amidst the ruins
of the Baths of Diocletian, a museum, composed of the objects found
on Government property since 1870. It promises to be one of the
most interesting collections in Rome. Amongst the objects of primary
importance we may mention the Ceres, found in the Stadium of
Domitian on the Palatine, 1878. The Apollo Ægioclus from Hadrian's
Villa. The bronze Meleager by Lysippus, found in February
1885 amidst the ruins of the Thermæ of Constantine on the Quirinal
Hill. The Boxer, also in bronze, found in the same place in April
of the same year. This is the most realistic statue preserved from
ancient days. The youth Bacchus, in bronze, found in the Tiber,
September 1885; probably by Praxiteles, or of his school.</p>

<p class="center p2">NEW ETRUSCAN MUSEUM&mdash;<a href="#Page_305">Page 305</a>.</p>

<p>The Government have formed in the Villa of Papa Julio a museum
of the objects recently discovered at Civita Castellana, the ancient
Etruscan city of Falerii. Our young friends will remember the
Schoolmaster and his Pupils. The objects are arranged in cases
round the rooms, and are of great interest; but they are considerably
mixed as regards their epochs. Three periods are represented&mdash;Native,
Etruscan, and Greek. Instead of these being arranged in
distinct cases, they are mixed up in nearly every case. Some of the
vases are fine works of art, whilst all are interesting. The wooden
coffins, hollowed out of trees, should be examined; also the skull
with the gold band, which formerly supported four false teeth.</p>

<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>The object of our work is to describe in a practical manner
the points of interest in and around the Eternal City. One
half of our life has been spent in studying Rome on the
spot. For our guides we have had the classic authorities
and recent excavations; and it has been with us a labour of
love to work out from our authors the meaning of the ruins
uncovered, and impart the information thus obtained to
others.</p>

<p>The excavations of the last few years have thrown an entirely
new flood of light upon the existing remains and Roman
history, and have proved beyond doubt that there is a great
deal more truth in the early history of Rome than has generally
been supposed. It has been our privilege to watch the excavations
year after year, and elucidate the remains found; and our
labours have been rewarded with some not unimportant discoveries.
We state nothing without citing classic authority to
bear us witness, and the authority so cited agrees in a marvellous
way with the ruins discovered. We feel that our efforts
have been appreciated by the many hundreds whom we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IV" id="Page_IV">iv</a></span>
guided to these classic spots, and we hope our book may be
likewise valued by those who cannot come to Rome.</p>

<p>These Rambles will enable the visitor who is making a brief
stay in Rome to see the principal objects of interest in a short
time.</p>

<p>By following the instructions given much time will be saved,
and the Rambler will not have to go over the same ground
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Visitors whose stay is limited to a few days should select the
subjects they are most interested in; whilst others, who have
"plenty of time," are advised to divide the Rambles according
to the time at their disposal.</p>

<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<p>To get a good idea of Rome and its topographical situation, take a
carriage and drive for three hours through the principal streets;
more can be learned in this way than in any other.</p>

<p><i>Start from the</i> Piazza di Spagna; drive down the Via Babuino to
the Piazza del Popolo, up to the Pincio, for a view of Rome, looking
west; then along the Via Sistina, up the Quattro Fontane, to the
right, down the Via Quirinale; stop in the square for the view. Proceeding
to the Via Nazionale, turn up it to the left as far as the
Quattro Fontane; then turn to the right past S. Maria Maggiore
direct to the Lateran, from the front of which see the view eastwards;
then follow the Via S. Giovanni down to the Colosseum, passing by
the most perfect part. By the Via del Colosseo, Tor di Conti, Via
Croce Bianca, Arco dei Pantani, Forum of Augustus, and Via Bonella,
you reach the Forum, under the Capitoline Hill. Continuing by the
Via Consolazione and Piazza Campitelli, follow the line of streets
to the Ponte Sisto; crossing this, proceed up the Via Garibaldi to
S. Peter in Montorio. Grand view of Rome and the Campagna,
looking north, east, and south.</p>

<p><i>Return</i> to the foot of the hill; turn to the left down the Lungara
to S. Peter's; drive round the square; then down the Borgo
Nuovo to the Castle of S. Angelo. Crossing the bridge, take the
Via Coronari to the Circo Agonale; then on to the Pantheon, and
by the Minerva to the Piazza di Venezia; thence up the Corso as
far as the Via Condotti, up which street you return to the Piazza
di Spagna, after having thus made the most interesting drive in
the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TOPOGRAPHY OF ROME.</h4>

<p>Rome commences at a point&mdash;Piazza del Popolo&mdash;and spreads out
southwards like a fan, the western extremity being occupied by the
Vatican, and the eastern by the Lateran; both these head-quarters
of the Papacy are isolated from the rest of the city. Modern
Rome occupies the valley of the Campus Martius, which was outside
ancient Rome, and the hills that abut it. Rome is divided into
two unequal parts by the river Tiber, which enters the line of the
walls, with the Popolo on its left. For a short distance it flows southwards;
then it makes a great bend to the west; then again takes a
southerly direction; and at the island again turns westerly. One
mile south of the Popolo Gate is the Capitoline Hill, the Arx of
ancient Rome, dividing, as it were, Old from New Rome. It rises
two hundred yards east of the Tiber, and from it in an eastern
direction lie the other six hills, curving in a horse-shoe form round
the Palatine till the Aventine abuts the river. Of the hills, the
Palatine, Capitoline, C&oelig;lian, and Aventine were only isolated
mounts, the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline being three spurs
jutting out from the high tableland on the east side of Rome. These
hills can easily be distinguished from the Tower of the Capitol; but
the best way to understand them is to walk round them. Then it will
be seen that they are hills indeed; and if we take into consideration
that the valleys have been filled in from thirty to forty feet, and that
the tops of the hills have been cut down, we may get some idea of
their original height. Rome still occupies four of them; but the
Aventine, C&oelig;lian, and Palatine are left to ruins, gardens, and
monks.</p>

<p>The original Rome was on the Palatine, and as the other hills were
added they were fortified; but it was not till the time of Servius
Tullius that the seven were united by one system of fortifications
into one city. The plan was simple. From the Tiber a wall went to
the Capitoline, and from that to the Quirinal; across the necks of the
three tongues the great agger was built, then across the valleys from
hill to hill till the wall again reached the river under the Aventine.
The aggers across the valleys were built right up towards the city,
so that the hills on either side protected the walls and gates commanding
the approach. Of all the maps of Rome that have been
published, the new one accompanying this work is the only one which
correctly shows the line of the Servian fortifications.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span></p>

<h4>THE PLAN OF OUR RAMBLES.</h4>

<p>From the Piazza del Popolo four great lines of thoroughfare intersect
the city, and passing up one of these for a few hundred yards we
may count five lines. First we take the centre thoroughfare; then
the two lines on its right; then the two upon its left: in this way,
by dividing Rome up into five Rambles, pointing out as we go along
every place of interest to the right and left, we mark out for a day's
work no more than can be thoroughly done. Having thus seen the
city, we take the environs outside each gate, commencing at the
Porta del Popolo and working round by the east, with the exception
of the Porta Appia, which leads out on to the Appian Way.
As this Way presents so many points of interest, and as no visitor
should think of leaving Rome without "doing it," we have made
it a special Ramble for their benefit.</p>

<h4>HEALTH AND CLIMATE.</h4>

<p>Perhaps the health of no city in the world is so much talked
about by people who know nothing whatever of the subject, as
Rome. We meet with many visitors entertaining all sorts of curious
ideas of the health of Rome&mdash;what they may and may not do; and
when we ask them their authority they cannot give any, but "they
have heard so." There seem to be mysterious ideas and impressions
floating about that get lodged in some minds no one knows how.
People get ill in Rome, of course, just as in any other place; but
more than half the sickness is caused through their own imprudence,
such as getting hot and going into cold places, and going "from
early morn till dewy eve" without rest and refreshment. In all hot
climates certain precautions should be observed, and then there is
no fear.</p>

<p>We ourselves have lived many years in this much-abused climate,
never knowing any illness, and enjoying far better health than when
residing in London. O ye rain, mud, and fog!</p>

<p>The well-known Roman physician, Dr. C. Liberali, M.D., in his
"Hygienic Medical Hand-book for Travellers in Italy," says:&mdash;"The
climate of Rome is in the highest degree salubrious and favourable
to all, but especially to delicate persons; but they should follow
the advice of a skilful physician of the country."</p>

<p>People rush through Europe at express rate, eat all sorts of things
that they are unused to at unusual hours, over-exert themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span>
change the whole course of the living to which they have been
accustomed, get ill, and then say, "It's the climate of Rome."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that malaria fever does exist in the neighbourhood
of Rome, but only during the three hot months; and as there
are no visitors at Rome then, they are not likely to get it. It does
not walk about the streets seeking whom it may devour, as some
people suppose.</p>

<p>The fever visitors get is ague fever, like that known in the Fen
districts, and this is invariably taken through imprudence.</p>

<h4>USEFUL HINTS.</h4>

<p>Avoid bad odours.</p>

<p>Do not ride in an open carriage at night.</p>

<p>Take lunch in the middle of the day. This is essential. It is
better to take a light breakfast and lunch, than a heavy breakfast
and no lunch.</p>

<p>No city in the world is so well supplied with good drinking water
as Rome. The best is the Trevi water. Do <i>not</i> drink Aqua Marcia;
it is too cold.</p>

<p>If out about sunset, throw an extra wrap or coat on, to avoid the
sudden change in the atmosphere. There is no danger beyond being
apt to take a cold. Colds are the root of all evil at Rome.</p>

<p>Do not sit about the ruins at night. It may be very romantic,
but it is very unwise. There is no harm in walking.</p>

<p>Close your windows at night.</p>

<p>If you get into a heat, do not go into the shade or into a building
till you have cooled down.</p>

<p>Do not over-fatigue yourself.</p>

<p>Follow these hints, and you will avoid that great bugbear, Roman
fever.</p>

<h4>THE TIBER.</h4>

<p>The work of clearing the bed of the Tiber has at last commenced.
It is proposed to clear away the accumulation of the mud at different
parts, remove some of the old masonry that stands in the bed of the
river, and widen it at certain points. We very much doubt if this
will have any effect upon the floods, as during the republic and
empire, when there was not all this accumulation, Rome was flooded
several times. The valley of the Tiber, in which Rome stands, is
very low, forming, as it were, a basin which is easily overflowed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">xv</a></span>
It would be advisable if the authorities were to clean out the old
drains, and put swing trap-doors over their mouths, so that the
drainage might flow out, and the river prevented from flowing in.
Every winter some part of the city is under water, which is caused
by the river rushing up the drains into the city, and not by the overflow
of the Tiber. This inpouring might easily be stopped.</p>

<p>Some people think that treasures will be found in the bed of the
Tiber, but this is a delusion. Nothing of any value has ever been
found in the river, and it is not likely that anything of value was
thrown there. Small objects only have been found in the recent
dredging. The story of the seven-branched candlestick being thrown
into the river is a delusion, for we have direct evidence to the contrary.
(See <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>.)</p>

<p>The piers of the bridges show that the actual bed of the river has
not been much raised; indeed the stream flows so fast that everything
is carried down to the sea.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> says anticipations may be entertained of finding the footstool
of Tullia, the jewels of Cornelia, the ivory-headed sceptre of the
senator Papirius, and the golden manger of the horse of Caligula.</p>

<p>The length of the Tiber is 250 miles. It rises due east of Florence,
in the same hills as the Arno. Its bed at the Ripetta in Rome is
5.20 metres above the sea, and it discharges at the rate of 280 cubic
metres a second. The fall from Rome to the sea is 4.20 metres,
or about thirteen feet, and it flows about five miles an hour.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'Behold the Tiber!' the vain Roman cried,</p>
<p>Viewing the ample Tay from Baiglie's side;</p>
<p>But where's the Scot that would the vaunt repay,</p>
<p>And hail the puny Tiber for the Tay?"</p>

<p class="i12"><span class="smcap">Sir Walter Scott.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The river was originally called the Albula, from its colour, and it
was named Tiberis, from King Tiberinus of Alba Longa, who was
drowned in it, and became the river-god (Dionysius, i. 71).</p>

<p>The ancient Romans looked upon their river with veneration; their
poets sang its praises, its banks were lined with the villas of the
wealthy, and its waters brought the produce of the world to Rome.</p>

<h4>HOW ROME BECAME RUINS.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The Goth, the Christian, time, war, flood, and fire,</p>
<p>Have dealt upon the seven-hilled city's pride."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Rome was founded in the year 753 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, and it gradually increased,
as we all know, till it became the capital of the world. By a summary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">xvi</a></span>
of dates we will endeavour to give an idea of the manner in
which Rome became ruins.</p>

<p>In July 390 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> it was devastated by fire. Up to 120 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> it was
subject to numerous raids by the Northerners, who, with the help of
civil war, and a devouring fire in 50 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, caused the destruction of
several of its most splendid buildings. In 64 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, during the reign
of Nero, a terrible fire ravaged the city for six days; and again in
89 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> another fire took place, lasting three days. In the reign of
Commodus a third fire occurred, which consumed a large portion of
the city. In 330 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> Constantine took from Rome a number of
monuments and works of art to embellish Constantinople. From
408 to 410 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> Rome was three times besieged by the Goths, under
Alaric, who plundered and fired the city; and in 455 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> the
Vandals took possession of Rome and plundered it. On June the
11th, 472 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, the city was captured by the Germans, under Ricimer,
and in 476 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> the Roman Empire was broken up.</p>

<p>About 590 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> continual wars with the Lombardians devastated
the Campagna. In 607 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> the Bishop of Rome was made Pope.
In 755 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> the Lombards again desolated Rome; and up to 950 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
it was held successively by the Emperor Louis II., Lambert Duke of
Spoleto, the Saracens, the German king Armilph, and the Hungarians.
In 1083 it was taken by Henry IV. of Germany; and in 1084 it
was burned, from the Lateran to the Capitol, by Robert Guiscard.
From the eleventh to the sixteenth century many of its buildings
were turned into fortresses by the nobles, who made continual war
upon each other; and during the "dark ages" the Romans themselves
destroyed many monuments, in order to make lime for building
their new palaces and houses.</p>

<p>Thus we see that when, in 55 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, Julius Cæsar, with his "<i>Veni,
vidi, vici</i>," conquered the little island now called Great Britain,
Rome contained in ruins many evidences of past splendour, and
whilst the Romans were overrunning the rest of Europe, their
empire was hastening to decay. We, the savages of those days,
have ever since been growing in strength and wisdom, laying the
foundations of future empires, overturning others, but not with the
idea of "universal conquest," but simply for a "balance of power."
Ancient Rome, by the help of invaders, flood, fire, the Popes, and its
inhabitants, was reduced to ruins, which have been in considerable
part preserved by an immense accumulation of soil, which, again,
caused them to be forgotten till recent explorations once more brought
them to light.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVII" id="Page_XVII">xvii</a></span></p>

<p>Modern Rome stands thirty feet above the level of Ancient Rome,
and is a strange mixture of narrow streets, open squares, churches,
fountains, ruins, new palaces, and dirt. Built during the seventeenth
century, the city is situated in a valley which formed part of
the ancient city, and lies to the north of it, being divided from it by
the Capitoline Hill, and offering to the visitor attractions which no
other city can boast. The germ of the old Roman race which civilized
the world is still alive, and is quickly rising to a new life&mdash;lifting
itself, after twenty centuries of burial, from the tomb of
ignorance and oppression. Here is the centre of art and of the
world's past recollections; here is spoken in its purity the most
beautiful of languages; here are a fine climate and a fine country;
and here are being strengthened the power and the splendour of united
Italy.</p>

<h4>THE WALLS OF ROME.</h4>

<h5>FIRST WALL&mdash;ROMA QUADRATA.</h5>

<p>The city of Romulus, upon the Palatine Hill, was called from its
shape Roma Quadrata. It occupied the half of what we know as the
Palatine, and was surrounded by a wall built up from the base of the
hill, and on the top of the scarped cliff: this wall can be still traced
in part. It was formed of large blocks of tufa, hard stone, and must
not be confounded with the remains of the Arcadian period, on the
Palatine, composed of soft tufa.</p>

<p>"Romulus called the people to a place appointed, and described a
quadrangular figure about the hill, tracing with a plough, drawn by
a bull and a cow yoked together, one continued furrow" (Dionysius,
i. 88).</p>

<p>"He began to mark out the limits of his city from the Forum
Boarium, so as to comprise within its limits the Great Altar of
Hercules. The wall was built with Etruscan rites, being marked
out by a furrow, made by a plough drawn by a cow and a bull, the
clods being carefully thrown inwards, the plough being lifted over
the profane places necessary for the gates" (Tacitus, xii. 24).</p>

<p>When the Sabines were approaching to attack the Romans, in
revenge for carrying off their women, Romulus strengthened the wall
of Roma Quadrata, and the Capitoline Hill was occupied as an outpost.</p>

<p>"He raised the wall of the Palatine Hill by building higher works
upon it, as a farther security to the inhabitants, and surrounded the
adjacent hills&mdash;the Aventine, and that now called the Capitoline
Hill&mdash;with ditches and strong palisades" (Dionysius, ii. 37).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVIII" id="Page_XVIII">xviii</a></span></p>

<p>"The city was difficult of access, having a strong garrison on the
hill where the Capitol now stands" (Plutarch, "Romulus," 18).</p>

<p>This hill was taken by treachery, and was not previously occupied
by the Sabines. It was called the Hill of Saturn, but after its capture
the Tarpeian Hill.</p>

<p>"While the Sabines were passing at the foot of the Capitoline
Hill, to view the place, and see whether any part of the hill could be
taken by surprise or force, they were observed from the eminence by
a virgin"&mdash;"Tarpeia, in execution of her promise, opened the gate
agreed upon to the enemy, and calling up the garrison, desired they
would save themselves"&mdash;"After the retreat of the garrison, the
Sabines, finding the gates open and the place deserted, possessed
themselves of it" (Dionysius, ii. 38, 39).</p>

<p>After peace was agreed upon, the two kings, Romulus and Titus
Tatius, reigned jointly, and surrounded the Palatine and Capitoline
Hills with a wall. The other hills, at this period, were not walled.</p>

<h5>SECOND WALL&mdash;THE WALL OF THE KINGS.</h5>

<p>We give it this title because it was built by the two kings jointly;
considerable portions still remain on the Palatine, under S. Anastasia,
and near the Forum of Augustus. The walls of Romulus and Tatius
would naturally be of similar construction to the original wall of
Romulus; there was but little difference in this short time.</p>

<p>"Romulus and Tatius immediately enlarged the city.... Romulus
chose the Palatine and C&oelig;lian Hills, and Tatius the Capitoline,
which he had at first possessed himself of, and the Quirinal Hills"
(Dionysius, ii. 50).</p>

<p>Numa erected the Temple of Vesta "between the Capitoline and
Palatine Hills; for both these hills had already been encompassed
with one wall; the Forum, in which this temple was built, lying
between them" (Dionysius, ii. 66).</p>

<p>The other hills were inhabited, and surrounded at different times
with walls, forming fortresses outside the city for the defence of the
city proper.</p>

<p>Numa "enlarged the circuit of the city by the addition of the
Quirinal Hill, for till that time it was not enclosed with a wall"
(Dionysius, ii. 62).</p>

<p>Ancus Martius "made no small addition to the city by enclosing
Mount Aventine within its walls, and encompassing it with a wall
and a ditch. He also surrounded Mount Janiculum with a wall"
(Dionysius, iii. 44).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIX" id="Page_XIX">xix</a></span></p>

<p>Florus says: "He [Ancus Martius] encompassed the city with a
wall." Again: "What kind of a king was the architect Ancus? how
fitted to extend the city by means of a colony [Ostia], to unite it by
a bridge [the Sublicius], and secure it by a wall?"</p>

<p>"The Quiritian trench also&mdash;no inconsiderable defence to those
parts, which from their situation are of easy access&mdash;is a work of
King Ancus" (Livy, i. 33).</p>

<h5>THIRD WALL&mdash;AGGERS OF SERVIUS TULLIUS.</h5>

<p>These seem to have been commenced by Tarquinius Priscus, and
completed by Servius Tullius, and so called by his name.</p>

<p>"He [Tarquinius Priscus] was the first who built the walls of the
city [of which the structure was extemporary and mean] with stones,
regularly squared, each being a ton weight" (Dionysius, iii. 68).</p>

<p>Tarquinius (616 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>) "intended also to have surrounded the city
with a stone wall, but a war with the Sabines interrupted his
designs" (Livy, i. 36).</p>

<p>"He set about surrounding with a wall of stone those parts of the
city which he had not already fortified, which work had been interrupted
at the beginning by a war with the Sabines" (Livy, i. 38).</p>

<p>"He [Servius] surrounded the city with a rampart, trenches, and
a wall, and thus extended the Pom&oelig;rium," 578 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> (Livy, i. 44).</p>

<p>"As the Esquiline and Viminal Hills were both of easy access
from without, a deep trench was dug outside them, and the earth
thrown up on the inside, thus forming a terrace of six stadia in
length along the inner side of the trench. This terrace Servius faced
with a wall, flanked with towers, extending from the Colline to the
Esquiline gate. Midway along the terrace is a third gate, named
after the Viminal Hill" (Strabo, v. 3).</p>

<p>"Tullius had surrounded the seven hills with one wall" (Dionysius,
iv. 14).</p>

<p>The seven hills were not surrounded, strictly speaking. Each hill
formed a bastion, and aggers, or curtains of earth faced with stone,
were built across the valleys, uniting these bastions. The Esquiline,
Viminal, and Quirinal, being ridges jutting out of the table-land and
not isolated hills, had one long agger built across their necks.</p>

<p>"Some parts of these walls, standing on hills, and being fortified
by nature itself with steep rocks, required but few men to defend
them, and others were defended by the Tiber.... The weakest
part of the city is from the gate called Esquilina to that named
Collina, which interval is rendered strong by art; for there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XX" id="Page_XX">xx</a></span>
ditch sunk before it, one hundred feet in breadth where it is narrowest,
and thirty in depth. On the edge of this ditch stands a wall,
supported on the inside with so high and broad a rampart that it
can neither be shaken by battering-rams nor thrown down by undermining
the foundations. This rampart is about seven stadia in
length and fifty feet in breadth" (Dionysius, ix. 68).</p>

<p>This grand agger can be traced almost in its entire extent, as also
the smaller aggers. There seems to have been no wall&mdash;that is,
stone or earth fortification&mdash;between the Aventine and Capitoline,
the Tiber being considered a sufficient defence.</p>

<p>"The city, having no walls in that part next the river, was very
near being taken by storm" (Dionysius, v. 23) when Lars Porsena
advanced to attack the city, after having taken the Janiculum, intending
to cross the river by the only bridge, which, as we know,
was defended by Horatius Cocles, and broken down by the Romans
in his rear.</p>

<p>The walls of Servius Tullius were strengthened at the time of the
war with Gabii.</p>

<p>"Tarquinius Superbus was particularly active in taking these
precautions, and employed a great number of workmen in strengthening
those parts of the city walls that lay next to the town of Gabii,
by widening the ditch, raising the walls, and increasing the number
of the towers" (Dionysius, iv. 54).</p>

<p>"On the eastern side it is bounded by the Agger of Tarquinius
Superbus, a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised it so high as
to be on a level with the walls on the side on which the city lay
most exposed to attack from the neighbouring plains. On all the
other sides it has been fortified either with lofty walls or steep or
precipitous hills; but so it is that its buildings, increasing and extending
beyond all bounds, have now united many other cities to it"
(Pliny, iii. 9).</p>

<p>"After Camillus had driven out the Gauls, both the walls of the
city and the streets were rebuilt within a year" (Plutarch, "Cam." 32).</p>

<p>"The legions being brought to Rome, the remainder of the year
was spent in repairing the walls and the towers," 350 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> (Livy,
vii. 20).</p>

<p>"They received a charge from the senate to strengthen the walls
and towers of the city," 217 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> (Livy, xxii. 8).</p>

<p>After the republic was firmly established, and the boundaries of
the state enlarged, the walls of the city became obsolete, and it was
to all intents and purposes an open city until the time of Aurelian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXI" id="Page_XXI">xxi</a></span></p>

<p>"All the inhabited parts around it [the city], which are many and
large, are open, and without walls, and very much exposed to the
invasion of an enemy. And whoever considers these buildings, and
desires to examine the extent of Rome, will necessarily be misled,
for want of a certain boundary that might distinguish the spot to
which the city extends, and where it ends. So connected are the
buildings within the walls to those without, that they appear to a
spectator like a city of an immense extent" (Dionysius, iv. 13).</p>

<h5>FOURTH WALL&mdash;THE WALL OF AURELIAN.</h5>

<p>From the time of Servius to Aurelian the city, though much
enlarged, had no new wall, though the boundaries had been extended.
To continue our last quotation from Dionysius, who died 7 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, this
is evident.</p>

<p>"But if any one is desirous to measure the circumference of it by
the wall&mdash;which, though hard to be discovered, by reason of the
buildings that surround it in many places, yet preserves in several
parts of it some traces of the ancient structure&mdash;and to compare it
with the circumference of the city of Athens, the circuit of Rome
will not appear much greater than that of the other" (Dionysius,
iv. 13).</p>

<p>The Pom&oelig;rium, or city bounds, was enlarged, as we know, by
several emperors, some of their <i>cippi</i>, or boundary-stones, being still
<i>in situ</i>; but there was no wall. Where the roads crossed the line of
the Pom&oelig;rium, gates were built, between which there were no walls.
The Romans considered the rivers Tigris, Euphrates, and Danube,
the desert and the ocean, as the walls of Rome.</p>

<p>"When he [Aurelian] saw that it might happen what had occurred
under Gallienus, having obtained the concurrence of the senate, he
extended the walls of the city of Rome" (Vopiscus, in "Aur.," 21).</p>

<p>"Thus also Rome was surrounded by walls which it <i>had not before</i>,
and the wall begun by Aurelian was finished by Probus" (Zosimus,
i. 49).</p>

<p>Other quotations might be given to show that Aurelian surrounded
the Rome of the empire with walls which it had not before his time.
He incorporated with his wall everything that stood in his way,&mdash;tombs,
aqueducts, palaces, camps, and amphitheatre. It was commenced
and finished in nine years, and had twenty-two gates, nineteen
of which still remain.</p>

<p>These present walls have been in part rebuilt, repaired, and
strengthened at different intervals, as occasion might require, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXII" id="Page_XXII">xxii</a></span>
the time of Honorius, who improved and added to the existing gates,
to that of Totila, who "resolved to raze Rome to the ground. So, of
the circuit of the walls he threw down as much in different places as
would amount to about a third part of the whole" (Procopius, "Bello
Gothico," iii. 22).</p>

<p>Belisarius "made hasty repairs," after which the Popes stepped in
and took up the tale, and put up inscriptions, so that there should
be no mistake about it. Leo IV. built the walls of the Leonine city,
to protect it from the Saracens, besides repairing the Aurelian walls.
The Leonine walls can still be traced, the ruins standing boldly out
in the landscape at the back of the Vatican.</p>

<p>The present wall on the Trastevere side was built by Innocent X.
and Urban VIII. The complete circuit of the present walls is between
twelve and thirteen miles; they contain twenty gates, ancient
and modern, nine of which are closed.</p>

<p>Whilst the Romans considered the defences of the city to be the
Tigris, Euphrates, Danube, desert, and ocean, their power was at its
zenith; but when for the defence of their capital it was necessary
to surround it with a wall, "the decline and fall of the Roman
empire" had already begun.</p>

<h5>THE GATES.</h5>

<p>In the third wall of Rome we learn from different authorities that
there were in all eighteen gates, commencing from the northern
point at the river bank,&mdash;Flumentana, Carmentalis or Scelerata,
Catularia (afterwards Ratumena), Fontinalis, Sangualis, Salularis or
Salutaris, Collina or Agonalis or Quirinalis, Viminalis, Esquilina,
Mæcia or Metia, Querquetulana, C&oelig;limontana, Firentina, Capena,
Lavernalis, Randuscula, Nævia, Trigeminia. The sites of most of
these have been identified. These names are culled from various
authors, no one author having given us a list of them.</p>

<p>Pliny gives us an account of the number of the gates in his time&mdash;thirty-seven
in all&mdash;which has puzzled a great many writers; but,
studying them on the spot, the description of Pliny is very plain and
easily to be understood. He says (iii. 9):&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the Vespasians were emperors and censors, in the year
from its building 827, the circumference of the M&oelig;nia 'boundary'
reckoned thirteen miles and two fifths. Surrounding as it does the
seven hills, the city is divided into fourteen districts, with two hundred
and sixty-five cross-roads, under the guardianship of the Lares.
The space is such that if a line is drawn from the mile column placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIII" id="Page_XXIII">xxiii</a></span>
at the head of the Forum to each of the gates, which are at present
thirty-seven in number, so that by that way enumerating only once
twelve gates, and to omit the seven old ones, which no longer exist,
the result will be a straight line of twenty miles and seven hundred
and sixty-five paces. But if we draw a straight line from the same
mile column to the very last of the houses, including therein the
Prætorian encampment, and follow throughout the line of all the
streets, the result will then be something more than seventy miles."</p>

<p>The gates may thus be analyzed:&mdash;</p>

<td class="tdhs tdr">37,</td>
<td class="tdhs" colspan="2">as mentioned by Pliny.</td>

</table>

<p>Of the twelve gates in the outer boundary, eight still remaining are
composed of work of an earlier date than the Wall of Aurelian. The
twelve may thus be named: the four gates of the Prætorian camp
(two of these partially remain, showing brick-work of Tiberius),
Porta Chiusa or Viminalis, Tiburtina, Esquilina now Maggiore,
Lateranensis, Latina, Appia, Ardeatina, Ostiensis.</p>

<p>Pliny (iii. 9) tells us that Tarquinius Superbus raised an outer
agger on the eastern side of Rome. Traces of this still remain, and
the tufa stones have been reused in Aurelian's work, whilst the
Porta Chiusa is partly formed on the inside of these blocks, and was
probably the work of the last of the Tarquins. The Porta S.
Lorenzo, or Tiburtina, bears inscriptions of Augustus and Vespasian;
Porta Maggiore, of Claudius, Vespasian, and Titus; whilst Porta
Lateranensis and Porta Ardeatina were undoubtedly built, as the
construction shows, by Nero; and the inner arch of the Porta S. Paolo,
or Ostiensis, is of the time of Claudius.</p>

<p>Tacitus (xii. 23) says: "The limits of the city were enlarged by
Claudius. The right of directing that business was, by ancient
usage, vested in all such as extended the boundaries of the empire.
The right, however, had not been exercised by any of the Roman
commanders (Sylla and Augustus excepted), though remote and
powerful nations had been subdued by their victorious arms."</p>

<p>"With regard to the enlargement made by Claudius, the curious
may be easily satisfied, as the public records contain an exact
description" (xii. 24).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIV" id="Page_XXIV">xxiv</a></span></p>

<h2>ROMAN CONSTRUCTION.</h2>

<p>When we speak of construction, we mean the material used in building
and the way it is put together. The different historical periods
of building are now classed into distinct dates, which have been
arrived at by observing the material used, and the way it is used, in
buildings of which there is no doubt as to the date of erection, and
comparing it with others. The early Greek Period in Italy is
marked by massive walls of masonry&mdash;walls built from the stone of
the vicinity, the blocks being rough as hewn out of the quarry,&mdash;polygonal.
The later Greek Period and the Etruscan are identical, being
formed of square blocks of stone, headers, and stretchers. In the
time of the kings of Rome the stones were squared, and were of tufa,
lapis ruber, tophus. In the earliest walls they are close jointed; in
the second period the edges are bevelled.</p>

<p>During the Republic the stones were also squared, but the material
was of peperino. Lapis Albanus and other forms of working up the
material were introduced. Pieces of stone, fixed together with
cement, gave a new kind of wall called <i>opus incertum</i>. This was
improved upon by facing the outside of the small pieces of stone and
making them of one uniform size&mdash;small polygonal. Then the stones
were cut into wedge shapes: the point being inwards, and being laid
in regular rows it has the appearance of network, and is called <i>opus
reticulatum</i>. This work, introduced in the last years of the Republic,
went out of fashion after the time of Tiberius, but was revived by
Hadrian, who always set his reticulated work in bands of brick like
a picture frame, thus distinguishing his from the earlier work, the
inside of the walls in those cases being concrete. The earliest brick
building which we have is the Pantheon. Thus it was under
Augustus that brick was first used by the Romans. It was his boast
that he found Rome of brick, and left it marble; which is only true in
a certain sense, for he did not build of solid marble, but cased veneering
marble on to the brickwork.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXV" id="Page_XXV">xxv</a></span></p>

<p>One period of Roman brickwork can easily be distinguished from
the others by measuring the number of bricks in a foot, and noticing
their uniformity of size. This, of course, does not refer to ornamental
brickwork. The brickwork of Nero is the best in the world&mdash;thin
narrow bricks, tiles, with very little mortar between them.
Before his time it was not quite so good; but after, it gradually
declined till the cement is as thick as the bricks.</p>

<p>The stone used during the Empire was travertine, <i>lapis Tiburtinus</i>,
but brick was the material generally used then. They are of two
colours, red and yellow, according to the clay from which they were
made. The walls were not of solid brick all through; but the interior
was made of pieces&mdash;rubble-work&mdash;the outside course being
entire brick, whilst at every four or five feet all through the construction
were laid the great tie-bricks to keep the rubble-work from
shifting. The brickwork was called <i>opus lateritium</i>. The great tie-bricks
are usually stamped with the names of the consul or emperor
and the maker, and these date the walls by measuring the number of
bricks there are in a foot. In the fourth century another system&mdash;<i>opera
decadence</i>&mdash;came into vogue, and walls were built with
layers of brick and pieces of tufa-stone a little larger than our
English bricks. This work continued down to the thirteenth century,
when <i>opera Saracenesca</i>&mdash;tufa-stones without the bricks between&mdash;came
into use. In the stone walls no cement was used; one stone
was simply placed upon another, its weight keeping it in its place,
and clamps were inserted to keep it from shifting. In the walls of
Roma Quadrata we know of no clamps having been found; but in
the wall of the two kings wooden clamps were found. In the walls of
Servius Tullius iron clamps were found; and in the Colosseum clamps
can still be seen in several places where pieces of the facing of the
stone have been split off.</p>

<p>Tufa is found all over the Campagna, and is of volcanic origin.
When the Alban Hills were active volcanoes, the ashes and scoriæ
thrown up fell into the sea, now the Campagna. The pressure of
water on it formed it into stone: where there has been a great
pressure, it is very hard; where little pressure, it is softer; and where
there was no pressure, it still remains a sort of sand&mdash;this mixed with
live lime is the celebrated Roman cement. The softer tufa was used
by the Greek colonists, and the hard stone by the kings of Rome.
Some tufa from the neighbourhood of Gabii is dark gray, the other
is brown and reddish. Peperino is also volcanic. It was ejected in
the shape of hot mud from the volcano, and on cooling formed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVI" id="Page_XXVI">xxvi</a></span>
good stone: this comes from the Alban hills, and was used in the
time of the Republic.</p>

<p>Travertine comes from Tivoli, and is a petrifaction formed by the
action of lime and sulphur on vegetable decay. This was not used
as a building material to any great extent before the time of Cæsar.
It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure. Silex is another
volcanic stone very little used for building, but entirely for paving
the roads both ancient and modern. This came out of the volcano
as a red-hot stream of lava, and on cooling down became a capital
paving material. The bed of the road was first properly prepared,
and then it was paved with polygonal blocks of blue basalt called
silex. The stones fitted close to one another. Many of the roads
are in a good condition to this day; the best specimen is opposite
the Temple of Saturn in the Forum, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 175. This stone is used
for <i>opus reticulatum</i> in some of the tombs on the Appian Way and at
the Temple of Hercules; also for concrete.</p>

<h4>THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO</h4>

<p>is a circular open space, adorned with fountains, and surrounded with
foliage. From this circle Rome spreads itself out like a fan southwards.
The four principal lines of thoroughfare diverge from this
spot&mdash;the Pincio, the Via Sistina, and the Via Quattro Fontane, leading
to the Esquiline, on the extreme left, along the hills; the Via
Babuino, leading into the Piazza di Spagna, on the left; the Corso,
leading into the Forum, in the centre; and the Via Ripetta, leading
into the oldest part of the present city, on the right: at the
corners of the three latter are the twin churches <span class="smcap">S. Maria in Monte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Santo</span>, and <span class="smcap">S. Maria dei Miracoli</span>, with domes and vestibules designed
by Rinaldi, and completed by Bernini and Fontana. In the
centre of the Piazza is an Egyptian obelisk, supported by a fountain
with four lionesses at the corners spouting water. <i>On the right</i>, under
the Terraces of the Pincio, are the statue of Rome by Ceccarini,
of Neptune between two Tritons, and statues of Spring and Summer,
by Laboureur. <i>On the left</i> are the statues of Autumn, by Stocchi,
and Winter, by Baini.</p>

<h4>THE EGYPTIAN OBELISK</h4>

<p>of the Piazza del Popolo was brought to Rome by Augustus, and
erected in the Circus Maximus. It is 78 feet 6 inches high, and
was erected on its present site by Pope Sixtus V. in 1589. This was
the first obelisk erected in Rome, having been brought by Augustus
after the death of Antony and Cleopatra. Pliny (xxxvi. 16) says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the most difficult enterprise of all was the carriage of these
obelisks by sea to Rome, in vessels which excited the greatest admiration.
Indeed, the late Emperor Augustus consecrated the one which
brought over the first obelisk, as a lasting memorial of this marvellous
undertaking, in the docks at Puteoli; but it was destroyed by
fire.</p>

<p>"And then, besides, there was the necessity of constructing other
vessels to carry these obelisks up the Tiber; by which it became
practically ascertained that the depth of water in that river is not
less than that of the river Nile.</p>

<p>"The one that he erected in the Campus Martius is nine feet less
in height, and was originally made by order of Sesothis. They are
both of them covered with inscriptions which interpret the operations
of Nature according to the philosophy of the Egyptians."</p>

<p>This has the name of two kings upon it: Seti, who went blind,
and his son Rameses, who succeeded him. It stood before the
Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis, and was placed by Augustus on the
Spina of the Circus Maximus, and re-dedicated, 10 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, to the Sun, as
the inscription informs us: IMP. CAES. DIVI. F.&mdash;AUGUSTUS&mdash;PONTIFEX
MAXIMUS&mdash;IMP. XII. COS. XI. TRIB. POT.&mdash;POPULI ROMANI REDACTA.&mdash;SOLI
DONUM DEDIT.</p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus (xvii. 4) supplies us with the following
information relative to obelisks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In this city of Thebes, among many works of art and different
structures recording the tales relating to the Egyptian deities, we
saw several obelisks in their places, and others which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
thrown down and broken, which the ancient kings, when elated at
some victory or at the general prosperity of their affairs, had caused to
be hewn out of mountains in distant parts of the world, and erected in
honour of the gods, to whom they solemnly consecrated them.</p>

<p>"Now, an obelisk is a rough stone, rising to a great height, shaped
like a pillar in the stadium; and it tapers upwards in imitation of a
sunbeam, keeping its quadrilateral shape, till it rises almost to a
point, being made smooth by the hand of a sculptor.</p>

<p>"On these obelisks the ancient authority of elementary wisdom
has caused innumerable marks of strange forms all over them, which
are called hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>"For the workmen, carving many kinds of birds and beasts, some
even such as must belong to another world, in order that the recollection
of the exploits which the obelisk was designed to commemorate
might reach to subsequent ages, showed by them the accomplishment
of vows which the kings had made.</p>

<p>"For it was not the case then, as it is now, that the established
number of letters can distinctly express whatever the human mind
conceives; nor did the ancient Egyptians write in such a manner,
but each separate character served for a separate noun or verb, and
sometimes even for an entire sentence.</p>

<p>"Of which fact the two following may for the present be sufficient
instances:&mdash;By the figure of a vulture they indicate the name of
nature; because naturalists declare that no males are found in this
class of bird. And by the figure of a bee making honey they indicate
a king; showing by such a sign that stings as well as sweetness
are the characteristics of a ruler. And there are many similar
emblems."</p>

<p><i>To the right of the Porta del Popolo is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. MARIA DEL POPOLO,</h4>

<p>founded by Paschal II. in 1099. Its interior consists of nave, aisles,
transept, and octagonal dome lavishly decorated by Bernini.</p>

<p>In the first chapel, to the right, the picture over the altar, the
Nativity of Jesus Christ, and the frescoes of the lunettes are by Pinturicchio.
The second chapel is that of the Cibo family&mdash;rich in
marbles, and adorned with forty-six columns of Sicilian jasper. The
picture of the Conception is by Maratta. The third chapel is painted
by Pinturicchio. In the fourth chapel is an interesting bas-relief of
the fifteenth century. The painting of the Virgin, on the high altar,
is one of those attributed to S. Luke; the paintings of the vault in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
choir are by Pinturicchio. The two monuments in marble ornamented
by statues are by Contucci da S. Savino. The last chapel but
one, in the small nave, is that of the Chigi family, and is one of the
most celebrated in Rome. Raphael gave the design for the dome, for
the paintings of the frieze, and for the picture of the altar, which
was commenced by Sebastiano del Piombo, and terminated by Francesco
Salviati. The statues of Daniel and Habakkuk were executed by
Bernini. The front of the altar and the statues of Elias and Jonah
are by Lorenzetti; but the design of the last is by Raphael.</p>

<h4>THE CORSO (Il Corso).</h4>

<p>Starting on our first ramble, we will take the line of the principal
street, the Corso, which takes its name from the races held during
the Carnival. It is on the line of the old Via Flaminia, the great
highroad which ran through the Campus Martius to the north. Many
handsome churches and palaces face the street, which is rather narrow
compared with our modern requirements. The Corso is the principal
promenade of the Romans, and possesses many points of interest.
At No. 18, <i>on the left</i>, lived Goethe; just beyond, <i>on the right</i>, in the
short Via S. Giacomo, was Canova's studio. <i>On the right</i>, further
down, is the Church of S. Carlo; passing by which, crossing the line
of the Via Condotti, <i>on our right</i> opens out the small square of
S. Lorenzo, in which is the</p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. LORENZO IN LUCINA,</h4>

<p>containing the grand work of Guido Reni, "The Crucifixion." It
is said that, being absorbed in his subject, he crucified his model.
The church contains a monument to Poussin, the relief being a copy
of his landscape of the tomb of Sappho in Arcadia. Opposite this
church is the English Baptist Chapel, under the Rev. James Wall,
founded for Romans.</p>

<p><i>Turning to the right, down the Corso, on the left, the Via Convertite
leads to</i></p>

<h4>THE GENERAL POST OFFICE (La Posta),</h4>

<p>in the Piazza S. Silvestro, <i>on the left</i>. It is a new building, recently
opened, and is fitted up with every modern appliance. The garden
in the centre, and the surrounding arcade with its frescoes, present
a refreshing appearance, and give a good idea of what the court
of a palace should be.</p>

<p><i>Opposite</i>, in the right corner of the square, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<h4>THE ENGLISH CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY,</h4>

<p>being the first Protestant church erected in Rome. It is in the form
of a basilica without aisles, and was designed by the late architect
Cipolla.</p>

<p><i>Regaining the Corso</i>, we soon arrive at the Piazza Colonna,
in which is</p>

<h4>THE COLUMN OF MARCUS AURELIUS.</h4>

<p>On the spot where the Palazzo Chigi now stands (<i>on our right</i>) a
temple was erected to M. Aurelius, in front of which was placed a
splendid pillar, with a spiral frieze winding up the shaft, and representing
the chief incidents of the war against the Marcomanni
(<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 174).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-047" id="i-047"></a>

<p class="caption">COLUMN OF MARCUS AURELIUS.<br />
<a href="images/i-047l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The shaft of this pillar is of precisely the same height as that of
the Pillar of Trajan. The pedestal, on the other hand, is much
higher, and rises considerably above the level of the modern pavement.
The present marble facing of this pedestal has been employed
to strengthen the foundations of the monument, which had been
much injured. The pillar, after having been frequently struck and
much damaged by lightning, was restored, at the command of
Sixtus V., by Fontana and his nephew Carlo Maderno. Looking
up, we perceive the iron cramps used to keep together the blocks of
marble, which had slipped out of their original position. But for
this support, this fine monument would long since have sunk beneath
the pressure of its own weight.</p>

<p>The sculptures are very interesting, but can no more be enjoyed
on the spot than those on the Pillar of Trajan. They represent
scenes from the battles fought in Germany. The column is formed
of 28 blocks of white marble, is 137 feet high, and is crowned with a
statue of S. Paul. Sixtus V., in restoring the Column of Marcus
Aurelius, in error inscribed it to Antoninus Pius.</p>

<p><i>Facing</i> the Piazza Colonna is a large palace. The columns which
form the portico were found in the ruins of Veii. <i>Our attention is
next attracted by</i></p>

<h4>THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE,</h4>

<p><i>situated in the Piazza Monte Citorio, behind</i> the Palace. Orders for
admission to special seats may be obtained from any deputy, but
there is a compartment in the gallery open to the public.</p>

<p><i>Opposite the Parliament House is an</i>

<h4>EGYPTIAN OBELISK.</h4>

<p>It was erected originally at Heliopolis to Psammeticus I., of the
twenty-fourth dynasty, more than six centuries <span class="s08">B.C.</span> It is 72 feet
high. Its first site in Rome was in the Campus Martius, where is
now the Piazza dell'Impresa, where it was found and taken to its
present site. The Roman pedestal with inscription is in the Church
of S. Lorenzo in Lucina. The obelisk was repaired, and its present
pedestal formed of fragments of the Antonine Column, which
stood near by. The obelisk was brought to Rome by Augustus at
the same time as the one in the Piazza del Popolo, and was put up,
according to Pliny (xxxvi. 15), as a sun-dial:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The one that has been erected in the Campus Martius has been
applied to a singular purpose by the late Emperor Augustus&mdash;that
of marking the shadows projected by the sun, and so measuring the
length of the days and nights. With this object, a stone pavement
was laid, the extreme length of which corresponded exactly with the
length of the shadow thrown by the obelisk at the sixth hour on the
day of the winter solstice. After this period the shadow would go
on day by day gradually decreasing, and then again would as gradually
increase, correspondingly with certain lines of brass that were
inserted in the stone&mdash;a device well deserving to be known, and due
to the ingenuity of Facundus Novus, the mathematician. Upon the
apex of the obelisk he placed a gilded ball, in order that the shadow
of the summit might be condensed and agglomerated, and so prevent
the shadow of the apex itself from running to a fine point of enormous
extent, the plan being first suggested to him, it is said, by the
shadow that is projected by the human head. For nearly the last
thirty years, however, the observations derived from this dial have
been found not to agree,&mdash;whether it is that the sun itself has
changed its course, in consequence of some derangement of the
heavenly system; or whether that the whole earth has been in some
degree displaced from its centre&mdash;a thing that, I have heard say, has
been remarked in other places as well; or whether that some earthquake,
confined to this city only, has wrenched the dial from its
original position; or whether it is that, in consequence of the inundations
of the Tiber, the foundations of the mass have subsided, in
spite of the general assertion that they are sunk as deep into the
earth as the obelisk erected upon them is high."</p>

<p><i>Regaining the Corso, the first turning on the right, Via Pietra, leads
into the</i> <span class="smcap">Piazza di Pietra</span>, in which are the ruins of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE.</h4>

<p>Eleven Corinthian columns, which formed a part of one side of
the temple, still stand, forming the entrance into a building once
used as a custom-house. They are 42½ feet high and 4½ feet in
diameter, supporting an architrave of marble which has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
recently restored. In the interior are some immense blocks of
marble which formed part of the vaulting. The temple, with the
Portico of the Argonauts which surrounded it, was erected by
Agrippa. It is now used as a chamber of commerce.</p>

<p><i>Continuing our ramble along the Corso, on the right</i> is the <span class="smcap">Palazzo
Simonetti</span>, on the left the <span class="smcap">Palazzo Sciarra</span>. The pictures here
have not been shown to the public for some years. Beyond, <i>standing
back</i>, is the <span class="smcap">Church of S. Marcello</span>, containing the celebrated
cherubs of Pierino del Vaga, the most exquisite things ever done in
fresco. The tomb of Cardinal Weld is also here.</p>

<p>Rienzi's body was hung up by the feet for two days in front of this
church.</p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARIA IN VIA LATA</h4>

<p>was founded in the eighth century, but was rebuilt in 1485, when
the tradition arose that it was on the site of the hired house of
S. Paul in Rome. Dodwell, the English explorer in Greece, was
buried here. There are also tombs of several members of the
Bonaparte family. <i>A door on the left of</i> the portico, built in 1662
from the designs of Pietro da Cortona, leads down into the subterranean
chambers, where a well is shown said to have been used by
S. Paul to baptize his converts. In an adjoining chamber S. Luke
is said to have painted his Madonna. Here are some remains of the
materials of the Arch of Claudius, which spanned the Via Flaminia
at this point; and an old piece of fresco, said to be by S. Luke.
These remains below the church formed part of</p>

<h4>THE SEPTA.</h4>

<p>Cicero Ad Atticum (iv. 15) informs us that Julius Cæsar commenced
a septa in the Campus Martius for the Comitia Centuriata
and Tributa. It consisted of a beautiful building of marble, surrounded
with a portico a mile square. It adjoined the Villa Publica.
It was completed by Lepidus the triumvir, and dedicated by
Agrippa (Dion Cassius, liii. 23). Frontinus (Aq. xxii.) says the
arches of the Aqua Virgo ended in the Campus Martius, in front of
the Septa.</p>

<p>The Comitia Centuriata, when the people assembled in their military
order, to elect their highest magistrates, to pass their laws,
and to vote upon peace or war, always met outside the walls in the
Campus Martius.</p>

<p>Comitia Tributa, for less important magistrates, tribunes, and
ædiles, met sometimes in the Campus Martius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>The Septa consisted of pens (hence the name), into which the
tribes passed to record their votes, which were given by ballot.
Every voter received a <i>tabella</i> (tablet), on which he wrote the
name of the candidate for whom he voted. He then dropped it into
an urn.</p>

<p>Near by, Agrippa built the Diribitorium, a large building used for
distributing and counting the ballot tickets. It was dedicated by
Augustus (Dion Cassius, lv. 8; Pliny, xvi. 40). During a fire Claudius
passed two nights here (Suetonius, "Claudius," xviii.).</p>

<p>These ruins extend under the Doria Palace, and have nothing to do
with any house. There were no houses on the Campus Martius in
Paul's time. (See <a href="#Page_197">page 197</a>.)</p>

into the vault, it will be seen that it is hewn out of the natural rock.
The Claudii family "received, from the state, lands beyond the Anio
for their followers, and a burying-place for themselves near the
Capitol" (Suetonius, "Claudius," i. 1).</p>

<h4>THE MAMERTINE PRISON,</h4>

<p>erected, according to Livy (i. 33) by Ancus Martius. "In order to
suppress the terror, the boldness which the vicious assumed from
hence (<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 121),<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and which gained ground continually, a prison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
was built in the middle of the city, adjoining the Forum." Servius
Tullius added a lower cell, called the <span class="smcap">Tullianum</span>, 6½ feet high and
19 feet by 9. Prisoners who were condemned to be strangled or to
die of hunger were thrust down the aperture; hence the phrase,
"to cast into prison." Sallust ("Catiline," lv.) thus describes
it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a place in the prison which is called the Tullianum
Dungeon. It is about 12 feet deep in the ground when you have
ascended a little to the left.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is secured round the sides by walls,
and over it is a vaulted roof, connected with stone arches; but its
appearance is disgusting and horrible, by reason of the filth, the
obscurity, and the stench. When Lentulus had been let down into
this place, certain men, to whom orders had been given, strangled
him with a cord."</p>

<p>The upper part of the Mamertine Prison was partly rebuilt in the
time of Tiberius, as we know from an inscription remaining in the
cornice over the flight of steps under the church.</p>

Consuls <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 23.</p>

<p>It seems to have been used exclusively for state prisoners. We
have records of the following, amongst others, who were confined
here:&mdash;</p>

<p>Manlius, who had defended the Capitol against the Gauls.&mdash;<span class="s08">B.C.</span>
382.</p>

<p>Quintus Pleminius, a prisoner for sedition.&mdash;<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 194.</p>

<p>Jugurtha, King of Numidia, who was starved to death <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 104.
He exclaimed, when cast in, "By Hercules! how cold is this bath
of yours!" (Plutarch, in "Caius Marius"), evidently speaking of the
spring as existing in those days.</p>

<p>Catiline conspirators, strangled by order of the Consul Cicero.&mdash;<span class="s08">B.C.</span>
55.</p>

<p>Vercingetorix, King of the Gauls, by order of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>Sejanus, the minister of Tiberius.&mdash;<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 31.</p>

<p>Simon, the son of Giora, the defender of Jerusalem against Vespasian.&mdash;<span class="s08">A.D.</span>
69.</p>

<p>In the centre of the upper chamber is the round aperture, covered
by a grate, down which the prisoners were cast.</p>

<p>Juvenal says: "Happy ages of the just, happy centuries, it may
be said, those which saw, formerly under the kings, as under the tribunes,
Rome content with one prison."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>One prison may have been enough in those times when it was
against the law to confine a Roman citizen before he was tried. We
have records of other prisons. Appius Claudius constructed a prison
for common offenders near the Forum Olitorium, the scene of "Roman
Charity." (See <a href="#Page_190">page 190</a>.) Pliny mentions "<i>Stationes Municipiorum</i>"&mdash;barracks
of the municipal soldiers&mdash;near the Forum of Julius
Cæsar. These may likewise have been prisons. In addition to
these, there was the <i>Lautumiæ</i>.</p>

<p><i>Below</i> the church, the Chapel of the Crucifixion occupies part of
the buildings of the prison, and from the sacristy a flight of modern
steps leads down into a lower cell, the Chapel of SS. Peter and Paul.
The entrance and steps from the street are also modern. In this
chamber, to the right of the altar, is a closed-up passage; it evidently
communicated with other chambers. On the tufa, carefully
guarded by iron bars, an indentation is shown which, they say, was
caused by the jailers beating Peter's face against the rock. (He
must have had rather a hard head!)</p>

<p>Another flight of modern stairs leads down into the Tullianum: the
opening down which the prisoners were cast can still be seen. The
iron door is the opening of a sewer leading into the Cloaca Maxima,
by which means the dead bodies, &amp;c., were taken away. This drain
is of the same construction as the Cloaca Maxima, and comes from
beyond the other chambers, mentioned below, with which it also
communicates.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic tradition is, that SS. Peter and Paul were
confined here, and they show the pillar to which they are said to
have been chained, though there are no marks of a staple having
been fixed in the stone, as represented in the bronze bas-relief; and
a fountain which miraculously sprang up when they had converted
their keepers, and they wished to be baptized: this was evidently
alluded to by Jugurtha.</p>

<p>The name Mamertine Prison is medieval. By the ancients it was
called <i>the Prison</i>, or the Tullian Prison.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The two chambers are
only a small part of the ancient prison, which extended up the left
side of the Clivus Argentarius, the modern Via Marforio, and
evidences of its extent can be seen in the cellars of the houses.
It evidently extended up as far as No. 68, for under that wine
shop we found two chambers corresponding with the two under the
church. The prison was approached from the Forum by a flight of
stairs called</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SCALÆ GEMONIÆ,</h4>

<p>or Stairs of Wailing. Criminals were often put to death on them,
and others were exposed there after death. "Those who were put
to death were exposed on the Scalæ Gemoniæ, and then dragged
into the Tiber" (Suetonius, "Tiberius," lxi.).</p>

<p><i>At a short distance from the church in the little lane opposite,
Via Marmorelle, 29</i>, are some more remains of the Prison, which
eventually became the</p>

<h4>"STATIONES MUNICIPIORUM" AND FORUM OF
JULIUS CÆSAR.</h4>

<p>"Julius Cæsar, with money raised from the spoils of war, began to
construct a new Forum" (Suetonius, "Cæsar," xxvi.)&mdash;the site costing
about £807,291. This new Forum was necessary, on account of the
old Forum becoming too small for the public business. Pliny (xvi.
86) mentions the barracks of the municipal guards as being between
the Vulcanal and the Forum of Julius Cæsar. These remains consist
of a series of five large chambers; one is forty feet long and fourteen
wide, divided by modern walls and partitions in various ways, and
not easy of access. The walls are of tufa. The vaults are of brick,
with openings for letting down prisoners. These are of later date
than the tufa walls, and one of them is supported by a fine arch of
travertine.</p>

<h4>THE ROMAN FORUM (Il Foro).</h4>

<p class="center"><i>(The new excavations are open to the public every day without fee.</i></p>

<p>To understand the Roman Forum and its surroundings, visitors
should attend the lectures given on the spot by the author of these
Rambles, descend with him to its level, and examine each remaining
object in detail; thus they may learn something of the buildings and
the history that crowded on its space. For particulars, apply at
93 Via Babuino, Rome.</p>

<p>Mutilated fragments still speak of the former grandeur of the spot,
dead men of its fame, and living authors of its past and present history.</p>

<p>In these Rambles we shall only treat of the most important and
present remains, which are classed in the order in which they should
be visited, and not chronologically.</p>

<p>The real foundation of the ancient city has long been covered over
by the heaping up, during ages, of earth, stones, rubbish, &amp;c., to the
depth of thirty feet. The thick crust had lain untouched by shovel
during the long series of popes; especially was this, until recently, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
condition of the Roman Forum. The latter is to be entirely excavated,
and the removal of the superincumbent earth is at this present
moment being made with a vigour never before attempted.</p>

<p>In short, the Forum is dressed up in quite a new attire, and
many old visitors would scarcely recognize it in its modern garb.
Crowds of spectators lean against the barriers every day, anxiously
reviewing the carting of the earth, and awaiting for artistic valuables
to "turn up."</p>

<p>The picturesqueness of the crowds, of the costumes and scenery,
the variety of language and nationality, the past associations, all go
to make up a spectacle quite unique.</p>

<p><i>We will follow the modern road, which crosses the Forum, and turning
to the left, proceed along the side of the Basilica Julia to the Temple
of Castor and Pollux, where a flight of steps gives access to the Forum.</i></p>

<p>Standing upon the platform of the temple, we propose to explain
the various buildings that surrounded the Forum, and then to descend
to its ancient level to examine the chief points of interest.</p>

<p>The word <i>forum</i>, in its simple signification, means market-place;
and the Roman Forum was the market-place when Rome consisted
of but two hills, the Palatine and Capitoline. It soon lost its primitive
use, and became the centre of the religious, civil, and political
life of the Romans. Then other market-places were formed, and
called after the principal commodity sold therein. In the time of
Cæsar the Forum was found too small, and then was commenced the
first of the Imperial Fora. The Forum, from the time of Constantine,
gradually fell into decay, and was finally ruined in the year
1084, when Robert Guiscard, the Norman chief, burned all Rome
from the Lateran to the Capitol.</p>

<h5>HOW THE SOIL ACCUMULATED.</h5>

<p>We may learn from the erection of the Column of Phocas, in
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 608, that the Forum was then unencumbered with soil. Rome
having been at that time deserted for a long period by its emperors,
its principal monuments began to fall into decay, the Romans
themselves hastening on the work for the sake of the marble; the
steady hand of time, allied with the luxuriant vegetation, working
slowly but surely, added to the <i>débris</i>; whilst deposits from the Tiber
floods, the wind, and the wash of the rain-shed, helped still more
to fill in the valleys. During a long course of years Rome was almost
abandoned; the streets remained unswept, and the rubbish of the
city collected upon them. At length a new life sprang up, and to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
dust of ages was added the refuse of building materials for the new
city, till in the year 1650 we have the Forum presented to us on a
level with the modern streets, under the name of the Campo Vaccino
(the Cow-field); and thus was the Forum filled up. Such are the
fluctuations of worldly splendour!</p>

<h5>EXTENT OF THE FORUM.</h5>

<p>The Forum was not, as many have supposed, a building, but an
open space surrounded with buildings, the whole forming the Forum.
It was 260 yards long, and 55 yards wide at the bottom. The top, under
the Capitol, was 140 yards wide. The temples were built on lofty
platforms (<i>podia</i>), to give them a more commanding appearance.</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF CASTOR AND POLLUX.</h4>

<p>Founded by Aulus Posthumius, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 268&ndash;74, in commemoration
of the battle of Lake Regillus. It was afterwards rebuilt by Lucius
Metellus. "Tiberius dedicated the Temple of Castor and Pollux,
which had been rebuilt out of the spoils of the German war, in his
own and his brother's name" (Suetonius, "Tiberius," xx.). "Caligula
converted it into a kind of vestibule to his house" (<i>Ibid.</i>, "Caligula,"
xxii.).</p>

<p>The three magnificent pillars still standing belonged to the side
facing the Palatine. They indicate approximately the south-east
boundary of the Forum. The narrower front looked down from a
terrace of considerable elevation upon the Forum, and was connected
with it by means of a double flight of stairs, the remains of which
were discovered during excavations made some time ago. These
pillars, as well as the fragments of the architrave and cornice supported
by them, are among the most beautiful architectural remains
of ancient Rome. The ornaments of the capitals and of the entablature
are as rich and splendid as they are pure and simple. It is
therefore probable that they belong to the time of Tiberius.</p>

<p>Pliny (x. 60) tells us of "a raven that was hatched upon the roof of
the Temple of Castor and Pollux, and flew into a bootmaker's shop
<i>opposite</i>. Every morning it used to fly to the Rostra which looked
towards the Forum (the Rostra Julia), where he would salute the
Emperor Tiberius, Germanicus, Drusus, and others, as they passed;
after which he returned to the shop. This the bird did for several
years, till the owner of an opposition shop, through jealousy, killed
him, for which the man was put to death; and such a favourite had
the bird become that he had a public funeral, and was buried in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
field of Rediculus, on the right-hand side of the Via Appia, at the
second milestone. No such crowds had ever escorted the funeral of
any one out of the whole number of Rome's distinguished men."</p>

<p><i>The Church of S. Maria Liberatrice, on our right, occupies the site of</i></p>

<h4>THE REGIA NUMÆ.</h4>

<p>"Numa erected a palace near the Temple of Vesta, called to this
day Regia" (Plutarch, "Numa"). Horace (O. i. 2) says: "We see
the tawny Tiber, its waves violently forced back from the Tuscan
shore, proceed to demolish the monumental Regia (Numæ) and the
Temple of Vesta." It was the residence of the Pontifex Maximus,
or chief priest, down to the time of Augustus. "Augustus presented
the Regia to the Vestal Virgins, because it adjoined their residence"
(Dion Cassius, lxv. 27). In the sixteenth century twelve inscriptions
relative to the Virgins were found near the church.</p>

<p><i>Opposite the church</i>, on the level of the Forum, is the round podium
of</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF VESTA.</h4>

<p>"Numa erected the Temple of Vesta (<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 37) between the Capitoline
and Palatine Hills; the Forum in which this temple was built
lying between them" (Dionysius, ii. 66). "It was made round, as a
symbol of the earth" (Ovid, "Fasti," vi. 265). "The roof was covered
with bronze of Syracuse" (Pliny, xxxiv. 7). It was destroyed by fire
under Nero and Commodus, and rebuilt by Vespasian and Septimius
Severus. It was the conservatory of the Palladium and holy fire.
The number of Virgins was originally four, afterwards increased to
six. They were bound to their ministry for thirty years. If they
broke their vow they were buried alive: they took their vows for
thirty years. "Ten years they were being instructed in their duties,
ten years they practised them, and ten years they passed in instructing
others" (Plutarch).</p>

<p><i>On the opposite corner of the Forum</i> ten columns and the side
walls remain of</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF ANTONINUS AND FAUSTINA.</h4>

<p>Erected by Antoninus Pius, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 160; and dedicated by the Senate
on his death to himself and wife, who were deified, as we learn from
the inscription,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
DIVO . ANTONINO . ET . DIVAE . FAUSTINAE . EX . S. C.</p>
</div>
<p>The vestibule of this edifice, composed of ten Corinthian pillars
of variegated green marble (cipollino) supporting an architrave and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
part of the cellæ, built of square blocks of peperino, still remain.
The architrave is adorned at each side with arabesque candelabra
guarded, as it were, by griffins.</p>

<p>The portico was excavated in 1876: the ascent to the Temple from
the Via Sacra was found to be by a flight of twenty-one steps, fifteen
feet in height. The portico now fulfils the same office to the Church
of S. Lorenzo in Miranda, which we understand is to be pulled down.</p>

<p><i>Between this temple and our vantage point</i> a mass of rubble work
marks the site of</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE-TOMB OF JULIUS CÆSAR.</h4>

<p>Ovid ("Met." xv., "Let." ii. 2), describes it as "close to Castor and
Pollux, having its aspect towards the Forum and the Capitol."
"They [the Triumvirs] likewise built a tomb to Julius Cæsar in
the middle of the Forum, with an asylum, that should be for ever
inviolable" (Dion Cassius, "Aug."). Before the temple was built,
"a column of Numidian marble, formed of one stone twenty
feet high, was erected to Cæsar in the Forum, inscribed&mdash;<span class="smcap">TO THE
FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY</span>" (Suetonius, "Cæsar," lxxxv.). This gave
place to the temple, which had four columns in front, as we learn
from a relief and a coin. It was decorated with the statues of the
Julian line. "About the time of the death of Nero, the Temple of
Cæsar being struck with lightning, the heads of all the statues in it
fell off at once; and Augustus's sceptre was dashed from his hand"
(Suetonius, "Galba").</p>

<p><i>We must now call attention to the buildings between the Temple of
Antoninus and the Church of S. Adriano on the line of the houses
shortly to be pulled down; but till the excavations are made, we cannot
be certain of the details. Next to the temple stood</i></p>

<h4>THE BASILICA ÆMILIA.</h4>

<p>In <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 180, "Marcus Fulvius made contracts for a court of justice
behind the new bankers' shops" (Livy, xl. 51). It was destroyed by
fire, and rebuilt by Paullus Æmilius, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 53.</p>

<p>Plutarch says that Paullus expended on it the large sum of money
he had received from Cæsar as a bribe.</p>

<p>Pliny (xxxvi. 24) tells us it was celebrated for its columns of
Phrygian marble.</p>

<p><i>For explanation of the word Basilica, see <a href="#Page_82">page 82</a>.</i></p>

<p><i>Between this and the Church of S. Adriano stood</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BASILICA PORCIA.</h4>

<p>In <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 185, "Cato purchased for the use of the people the two
houses, Mænius and Titius, in the Lautumiæ, and four shops, erecting
on that ground a court of justice, which was called the Porcian"
(Livy, xxxix. 44). "The tribunes likewise opposed him very much in
his building, at the public charge, a hall below the Senate House, by
the Forum, which he finished notwithstanding, and called it the
Porcian Basilica" (Plutarch, in "Cato").</p>

<p>This is where the tribunes of the people used to hold their
courts. It was destroyed by fire at the same time as the Curia.</p>

<p><i>Behind was</i></p>

<h4>THE FORUM PISCATORIUM,</h4>

<p>or Fish-Market. Plautus ("Capteivei," Act iv., Scene 2) says "that
the stench of the fish frequently drove the frequenters of the Basilica
Porcia into the Forum Romanum."</p>

<p>The Market was destroyed by fire <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 212 (Livy, xxvi. 27), and
rebuilt <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 180 (Livy, xl. 51). "Marcus Fulvius contracted for the
rebuilding of the Fish-Market."</p>

<p><i>In this district</i> was also</p>

<h4>THE LAUTUMIÆ.</h4>

<p>It was not only a district near the Forum, but a prison, as the name
signifies, made out of stone quarries. It is first mentioned (<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 212)
by Livy (xxvi. 27) in his account of the fire. Livy (xxxii. 26; xxxvii. 3)
says it was a place for the custody of hostages and prisoners of war.
When Q. M. Celer the consul was imprisoned there by the tribune
L. Flavius, Celer attempted to assemble the Senate in it (Dion
Cassius, xxxvii. 50); so we may infer that it was a large building.
The <i>Lautumiæ</i> was <i>entirely distinct</i> from the Mamertine
Prison.</p>

<p><i>The church with the plain front, S. Adriano, and the house with the
green shutters, occupy the site of</i></p>

<h4>THE SENATE HOUSE,</h4>

<p>originally built by Tullus Hostilius one hundred years after the
foundation of Rome, and called the Curia Hostilia. "He built a
Senate House, which retained the name Hostilia even within the
memory of our fathers" (Livy, i. 30).

<p>It was destroyed by fire when the body of the tribune Clodius was
burned, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 702. Rebuilt by Faustus, the son of Sylla. Destroyed
a second time, to do away with the name of Sylla, on pretence of
erecting the Temple of Felicity; rebuilt by Julius Cæsar, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 711,
completed by the Triumvirs, and consecrated by Augustus, who
named it the Curia Julia. Again destroyed by fire under Titus, and
rebuilt by Domitian, and called Senatus.</p>

<p>It was approached by a flight of steps; for "Tarquin carried old
Servius out of the Curia, and threw him down the steps to the
bottom" (Livy, i. 48).</p>

<p>This was the proper Senate House; and when we read of the
senators meeting in other places, there was always some special
reason for their so doing. The tradition of the church, S. Adriano,
is, that it was erected out of the remains of the Senate House, the
bronze doors of which were carried off to the Lateran by Alexander
VII., where they still remain.</p>

<p>An anonymous writer, quoted by Eckhard, states that in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 283,
under Carinus, a fire destroyed the Curia Julia, the Græcostasis, the
Basilica Julia, and the Forum of Cæsar, all of which were restored
by Diocletian, 290. The Senate House seems to have been again
destroyed, and rebuilt by Flavianus, prefect of the city, in 399,
under the title of "Secretarium Senatus;" another prefect, Eucharius,
restored it in 407.</p>

<p><i>The Church of S. Martino occupies the site of</i></p>

<h4>THE GRÆCOSTASIS AND SENACULUM.</h4>

<p>Varro ("Ling. Lat.," v. 155) says: "The Græcostasis was on the
right of the Curia, and projected in front of it; and here the
Senate received the foreign ambassadors in audience. The Senaculum
lay above the Græcostasis, and towards the Temple of Concord,
and the senators deliberated in this building with the magistrates
who were not entitled to enter the Senate House."</p>

<p>Between S. Martino and S. Adriano the Via Bonella runs out of
the Forum on the line of</p>

<h4>THE ARGILETUM,</h4>

<p>which passed through the Fora of Cæsar and Augustus to the
Suburra. It was the Paternoster Row of ancient Rome. "Thou
preferrest, little book, to dwell in the shops in the Argiletum"
(Martial, i. 3).</p>

<p><i>At its entrance stood</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BRONZE SHRINE OF JANUS.</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 39, "Numa built a shrine to Janus, near the foot of the
hill Argiletum, which was to notify a state either of war or peace"
(Livy, i. 19). Ovid ("Fasti," i. 259) says, "Thou hast a shrine
adjoining two Fora" (the Forum of Cæsar and the Roman Forum).
"There was a Janus in the Forum before the Curia. This temple was
made entirely of bronze, and of a square form; it was hardly large
enough to hold the figure of Janus. The bronze image was four cubits
high; in other respects like a man, except that it had two faces, one looking
towards the east and the other towards the west. There were bronze
doors in each front" (Procopius, "Bel. Got." i. 25). A brick podium
under the right end column of the Arch of Severus marks its site.</p>

<p><i>Somewhat in the foreground is</i></p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS,</h4>

<p>erected, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 205, in honour of the emperor and his two sons, Caracalla
and Geta, by the senate and people of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The sculptures
adorning it are interesting, and represent
his victories over the Parthians,
Arabians, and Adiabenes.</p>

<p>A chariot, containing the statues of
the emperor and his sons, drawn by
six horses (now in S. Mark's, Venice),
stood on the summit. The sculptures
represent details of the Roman military
harangues, sieges, camps, assaults
with battering-rams, and the submission
of prisoners. The front towards
the Forum represents the emperor
addressing his troops, the taking of
Carrha, the siege of Nisibis. The front
facing the Capitol represents another
harangue, the siege of Atra, and the
passage of the Euphrates and Tigris.</p>

<p><i>In front of the arch are the bases of</i></p>

<h4>THE DUILIAN COLUMN,</h4>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-065" id="i-065"></a>

<p class="caption">DUILIAN COLUMN.<br />
<a href="images/i-065l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>erected <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 493. "Caius Duilius
was the first to gain a naval triumph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
over the Carthaginians: his column still remains in the Forum"
(Pliny, xxxiv. 11). It was of bronze, made out of the rostra
of the captured ships. Being struck by lightning, it was restored
by Germanicus, under Tiberius, and part of his inscription
is still to be seen in the column made to receive it by Michael
Angelo in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, on the Capitol.</p>

<h4>THE MÆNIA COLUMN</h4>

<p>"was erected in honour of C. Mænius, who conquered the ancient
Latins, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 416, and to whom the Romans gave a third of the
spoil" (Pliny, xxxiv. 11).</p>

<p><i>Immediately behind the Arch of Severus are the remains of</i></p>

<h4>OPIMIUS'S TEMPLE OF CONCORD.</h4>

<p>Here was originally a shrine erected by Flavius. Livy (ix. 46) says,
"In <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 449, to the great displeasure of the nobles, Caius Flavius performed
the dedication of the Temple of Concord, in the area of Vulcan."</p>

<p>Pliny (xxxiii. 6) gives us further particulars, and points out the exact
site:&mdash;"Flavius made a vow that he would consecrate a temple to
Concord, if he should succeed in reconciling the privileged orders
with the plebeians; and as no part of the public funds could be voted
for the purpose, he accordingly built a small shrine of bronze near
the Græcostasis, then situated above the Comitium, with the fines
which had been exacted for usury.</p>

<p>"Here, too, he had an inscription engraved upon a tablet of brass,
to the effect that the shrine was dedicated 203 years after the consecration
of the Capitoline Jupiter."</p>

<p>The third temple, Livy (xxii. 33) says, "was erected in the Citadel,
<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 538, the Temple of Concord vowed by the Prætor Lucius Manlius,
on occasion of the mutiny of some soldiers in Gaul, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 536."</p>

<p>The fourth temple was dedicated to Concord by the Consul Lucius
Opimius, after the death of Gracchus, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 632. Appianus (i. 26) says "it
was in the Forum." Varro ("L.L." v.) says, "The Senaculum was above
the Græcostasis, towards the Temple of Concord and Basilica Opimia."
Festus says it was "between the Capitoline Hill and the Forum."</p>

<p>The Senaculum was distinct from the Curia. Thus Livy (li. 27)
says, "The censors constructed a portico from the Temple of Saturn
on the Capitol to the Senaculum, which was above the Curia." The
inscription has been preserved to us:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BASILICA OPIMIA.</h4>

<p>At the back of the ruins of the temple are the remains of the
Basilica Opimia. Part of the ground-plan is shown on a fragment of
the marble map of Rome, with a fragment of a basilica behind. On
examination of the ruins, the two buildings can be distinctly made out.</p>

<p>In front are the ruins of the steps and portico, with the cella
behind. There seems to have been at the back of the cella an
entrance into the basilica, both being closed with independent doors.
The marble threshold of the temple is <i>in situ</i>, and upon it is cut a
<i>caduceus</i>, the emblem of Concord, which was once filled in with
bronze; parallel to this, but distinct, is the marble threshold of the
basilica, with the holes where the pivots of the doors turned. Under
the podium of the basilica is a long narrow vault of <i>opus incertum</i>,
but it does <i>not</i> lead into the Tabularium, that being built long afterwards,
<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 675, as the old inscription records, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 78. It was probably
the place where the utensils for the temple were deposited. Some of
the marble decorations of the basilica still remain; and this was no
doubt the hall used when the Senate are spoken of as having sat in
the Temple of Concord. "The Senate assembled in the building
near the Temple of Concord" (Dion Cassius, lviii. 2). "In this
temple, in which, whilst I was advising the Senate, you placed around
it armed men" (Cicero, "2 Phil." vii. and viii.). "Here, in this Cella
of Concord, on the slope of the Capitol."</p>

<p>It may be that this is the basilica spoken of in later times as the
Basilica Argentaria, probably taking that name from being frequented
by the silversmiths. It was restored, after a fire, by Septimius Severus,
and the inscription quoted is probably of his date. In <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 731&ndash;741, Pope
Gregory III. turned the remains into a Christian church, which exists
no longer. In 1817, three inscriptions were found here, referring to
the temple and basilica. Cicero ("Per Sest." lxvii.) tell us "that the
monuments of L. Opimius in the Forum were very much frequented."</p>

<p>A Temple of Concord seems to have been decorated with many
statues, but there is nothing to show whether it was that of Camillus
on the Capitol, or Opimius's.</p>

<p>"Piston also made the statues of Mars and Mercury, which are in
the Temple of Concord at Rome." "Sthenius made the statues of
Ceres, Jupiter, and Minerva, which are now in the Temple of Concord."
"Augustus consecrated in the Temple of Concord, as something marvellous,
four figures of elephants made of obsidian stone." "Also, a picture
of Marsyas bound by Leuxis" (Pliny, xxxiv. 19, xxxv. 36, xxxvi. 67).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"Vitellius left the palace to lay down the ensigns of sovereignty in
the Temple of Concord" (Tacitus, "H." iii. 68).</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF VESPASIAN.</h4>

<p>Vespasian having rendered such services by restoring the Capitol,
and collecting the records in the Tabularium, no more suitable site
could be found for the erection of a temple to the deified emperor
than in front of an old entrance to this latter building. The three
pillars, which are all that remain of the building, stand upon a lofty
terrace; and the skill of the architect in concealing the limited depth
of the space allotted to the temple is shown in his having placed the
columns of the flank nearer to each other than those of the front.</p>

<p>The beauty of this ruin excites universal admiration. It approaches
that of the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Forum. The inscription
on the architrave, copied, whilst still entire, by a monk of the
monastery of Einsiedeln, in the eighth century, refers to the restoration
of the building by Septimius Severus and Caracalla, who appear
to have also restored other sanctuaries in the same neighbourhood.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF SATURN.</h4>

<p>"The temple was consecrated to Saturn, upon the ascent leading
from the Forum to the Capitol. Before this, the altar erected by
the followers of Hercules stood there" (Dionysius, vi. 1. See <i>ibid.</i>,
i. 34).</p>

<p>Only eight Ionic columns, with their capitals and architraves,
remain. It was on the steps of this temple that the generals took the
oath that they had given a correct account of their spoil and prisoners.
It contained the public treasury, and, according to Solinus, was called
the Treasury of Saturn. Livy (ii. 21) says, "In the consulate of
Aulus Sempronius and Marcus Minucius, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 257, the Temple of
Saturn was dedicated." Plutarch says, "Publicola appointed the
Temple of Saturn to be the treasury, which they still make use of for
that purpose, and empowered the people to choose two young men as
quæstors or treasurers." The inscription is still <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<h4>THE MILLIARIUM AUREUM,</h4>

<p>or Golden Milestone, set up by Augustus (Dion Cassius, liv. 5), the
site of which is at the angle of the temple on the side of the old
Clivus Capitolinus, the ancient road leading up from the Forum. It
was a gilded stone, on which the distance of all the principal towns
was recorded, the distance being always measured from the city
gates. Suetonius ("Otho," vi.) tells that "Otho gave his accomplices
notice to wait for him in the Forum near the Temple of Saturn, at
the Golden Milestone." Tacitus ("H." i. 27) relates the same; and
Plutarch (in "Galba") agrees with them both, adding, "There terminate
all the great roads in Italy."</p>

<p><i>Behind the Temple of Saturn, in the corner, is</i></p>

<h4>THE PORTICO OF THE TWELVE GODS,</h4>

<p>the Schola Xantha, and the portico of the Dii Consentes, restored
by Visconti in 1858, marked by eight Corinthian columns, partly
modern, but with antique capitals and architraves; and the cellæ
arranged in compact masonry behind them. It was called the Schola
Xantha, from Fabius Xanthus, a curator of the monuments, who
placed here the images of the household gods of Rome&mdash;Dii Consentes,
because admitted to the council of Jove&mdash;Juno, Vesta, Minerva,
Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jovi', Neptunus, Vulcanus,
Apollo (Ennius). The inscription tells us they were reinstated under
Vettius Pretextatus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 367.</p>

<p><i>Facing towards the Forum, at the back of the line of buildings at its
top, is</i></p>

<h4>THE COLUMN OF PHOCAS,</h4>

<p>which formerly supported the statue of that emperor. It faced the
Senate House; and is placed upon a pedestal rising from a pyramidal
basement of steps, the whole evidently the plunder of other edifices.</p>

<p>It was erected by Smaragdus, the Exarch of Italy, in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 608, and
was excavated by the Countess of Devonshire in 1816.</p>

<p>It is thus mentioned by Byron,&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE BASILICA JULIA,</h4>

<p>on the site of the Basilica Sempronia, erected by Sempronius Gracchus,
<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 169 (Livy, xliv. 16). This was burned down, and rebuilt by
Julius Cæsar, and called Julia, after his daughter. It was destroyed
by fire, and rebuilt by Augustus (Dion Cassius, "Augustus"). It
was again destroyed by fire, and rebuilt <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 283. Suetonius tells
us that Caligula, "during three days successively, scattered money
to a prodigious amount among the people, from the top of the Julian
Basilica" ("Caligula," xxxvii.). It is shown on two pieces of the
marble plan.</p>

<p>In the "Mon. Ancyr.," Augustus says, "He rebuilt the Basilica
Julia between the Temples of Castor and Saturn." Thus we see that
the Will of Augustus, the marble plan, and the ruins, all three
exactly agree. The portico was dedicated to his grandsons, Lucius
and Caius (Suetonius, "Augustus," xxix.). It was the great court of
appeal. (See Pliny, Jr., "Letters," v. 21, vi. 33.)</p>

<p>The old pavement has been well exposed, and put in proper condition
for preservation; the remnants of frieze, and cornices, and
columns found in the diggings have been set up on brick pedestals,&mdash;an
innovation of Signor Rossa's. The old bits of pavement have been
very smoothly linked together by the laying of Venetian mosaic cement,
and the contrast between the modern and the antique is very apparent.</p>

<p>The principal streets that ran into the Forum were:&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE VIA SACRA.</h4>

<p>It commenced on the Palatine Hill at the Ædem Larium. Passing
by the Arch of Titus, it turned to the left: thus far it was called the
Clivus Palatinus and Summa Sacra Via; the slope down to the Forum
was called the Clivus Sacer. It entered the Forum at the Temple of
Antoninus, past which it turned again to the left, passing in front of
the Temple of Cæsar; then turning to the right, passed through the
centre of the Forum to the foot of the Capitol. The ascent here
was called the Clivus Capitolinus. It was paved <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 174 (Livy,
xli. 27).</p>

<p>Its windings are easily accounted for when we remember that it
had to come from the top of the Palatine to the top of the Capitoline,
passing through a narrow valley. It was called the Sacred Way
from the sacred processions that passed along it, and from the sacred
buildings that lined it.</p>

<p><i>Between the Basilica Julia and the Temple of Castor</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<h4>THE VICUS TUSCUS</h4>

<p>ran to the forum of the cattle-dealers and Circus Maximus. "They
had ground allotted to them for building houses, which was afterwards
called the Vicus Tuscus" (Livy, ii. 14). "Verres had caused
it to be paved so badly, that he made a point of never going along
the street that he had taken the contract for paving" (Cicero, "Ver."
i. 59). It was the route for the festal processions to the Circus
and Aventine. Where it entered the Forum was a statue of the
Tuscan god Vertumnus, the base of which statue was found near
where the street first touched the Basilica Julia. This street was
sometimes called the Vicus Thurarius, from the perfumers' shops.</p>

<h4>THE VICUS JUGARIUS</h4>

<p>went out of the Via Sacra between the Temple of Saturn and the
Basilica Julia, running under the Capitol to the Porta Carmentalis,
the gate in the wall from the Capitol to the river that led into the
forum of the vegetable-dealers. Where it left the Via Sacra it was
spanned by the Arch of Tiberius, erected <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 16 in commemoration
of the lost eagles of Varus being recovered by Germanicus (Tacitus,
"Annals," ii. 41). In this street was the Lacus Servilius.</p>

<p>Under our (right) side of the Temple of Castor are some remains of</p>

<h4>THE STREET OF THE OX-HEADS.</h4>

<p>From the Porta Romana on the Palatine, a short street went to
the right out of the Via Nova into the Forum, ending between the
Temples of Castor and Vesta. "It chanced that I was returning
from the festival of Vesta by that way by which the Nova Via is <i>now</i>
joined to the Roman Forum" (Ovid, "Fasti," vi. 389.) We wish Mr.
Naso had been a little more explicit, and had given us the name of
this short street; but we will endeavour to demonstrate what the
name of this street was. We know from Suetonius that under the
Palatine was the temple to the deified Augustus, and over it Caligula
built his bridge, connecting the Palatine with the Capitol. Now, at
the corner of the Palatine we have the ascent to this bridge remaining,
so that it will not be difficult to find the probable site of the
Temple of Augustus. Horace (O. iii. 3) implies that it was between
the Temples of Castor and Hercules. Servius says it was near the
Tuscan colony. Suetonius tells us it was on the site of the house in
which he was born, and gives us the name of the street: "In the quarter
of the Palatine Hill, and the street called the Ox-heads, where <i>now</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
stands a temple dedicated to him, and built a little after his death"
("Aug." v.). We conclude from the above that the probable name of
this short street was <span class="smcap">Ad Capita Bubula</span>, and in confirmation of this,
ox-heads may still be seen sculptured on the fragments found at the
end of this street, between the Temples of Castor and Vesta.</p>

<h4>MINOR STREETS.</h4>

<p>We must call attention to a cross street that ran from the Clivus
Capitolinus to the Prison and the Clivus Argentarius, the name of
which we cannot determine, unless it was reckoned part of the
Argentarius. When the triumphal processions arrived at this point,
the general and prisoners separated. He went up the Capitol to
sacrifice, they to the Prison to death.</p>

<p>The road passing under the Arch of Severus is of very late date,
and artificially formed. It ran from the cross street down the north
side of the Forum for a short distance, when it turns to the left,
apparently passing out of the Forum between the Curia and the
Basilica Porcia. The roads, as a rule, did not pass under the triumphal
arches, as they are represented on reliefs and coins, with the
archways occupied with statues.</p>

<p><i>The open paved space, which was very much larger in the time of the
Republic, was called</i></p>

<h4>THE COMITIUM.</h4>

<p>Varro says it was so called "from <i>coïre</i>, to meet,&mdash;the place of the
ratification of the treaty between the Romans and Sabines." Livy
tells us "it was an open space marked out in the Forum, where the
assemblies called Comitia Curiata took place for the purpose of
electing ministers of religious rites, making laws of a certain description,
and deciding some suits, and inflicting punishment on criminals."</p>

<p>Domitian ordered the gallants of Cornelia, the president of the
Vestal Virgins, to be whipped to death with rods in the Comitium.</p>

<p>A line of seven brick bases for honorary statues occupies one side;
the edge of the paved area marks the top; the remains of a row of
shops, destroyed by Signor Rossa in 1872, the bottom. The line of
the modern road on the right was called</p>

<h4>THE JANUS.</h4>

<p>This was the Roman Exchange, where the money-changers transacted
their business, and must not be confounded with the Temple
of Janus already mentioned; nor must it be thought that there were
a series of arches here, as some authors have supposed. Horace says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
(Sat. ii. 3), "Since all my fortunes were dissipated at the middle
exchange" (Janus). Again (Ep. i. 1), "O citizens, money is to be
sought first; virtue after riches. This is inculcated from the top to
the bottom of 'change." He here distinguishes the <i>summus</i>, <i>medius</i>,
and <i>imus</i>, or the top, middle, and bottom of the exchange.</p>

<h4>SHRINE OF VENUS.</h4>

<p>Having thus pointed out the principal buildings of the Forum, we
will descend to its level, and identify some of its historical sites.</p>

<p><i>At the left-hand corner</i> of the Vicus Tuscus and the Via Sacra, a
brick pedestal marks the site of the Shrine of Venus Cloacina, erected
in commemoration of Tarquin making the Cloaca Maxima. <i>Cloacina</i>
comes from <i>cluere</i> = <i>purgare</i>, to purge.</p>

<h4>THE DEATH OF VIRGINIA.</h4>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-074" id="i-074"></a>
<img src="images/i-074.jpg" width="434" height="340" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DEATH OF VIRGINIA.<br />
<a href="images/i-074l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>Opposite</i> this shrine, facing up the Vicus Tuscus, is some brickwork&mdash;remains
of a line of shops that faced towards the Temple of
Cæsar, and which were destroyed by Signor Rossa in making the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
excavations. The end shop only was saved. This was the site of the
butcher's stall from which Virginius snatched the knife that saved
his daughter's honour.</p>

<p>"Virginius demanded to speak with Virginia; and permission being
granted, he drew the maiden and her nurse aside to the shops near the
shrine of Cloacina, now called the new shops, and there, snatching a knife
from a butcher's stall, plunged it into his daughter's breast" (Livy,
iii. 48).</p>

<h4>THE FOUNTAIN OF JUTURNA.</h4>

<p><i>At the left-hand corner</i>, facing the Temple of Castor, the oval basin
of this fountain has been cleared, and the spring which supplied it is
covered with an iron grating, and has been turned into the Cloaca.
It is no doubt the same at which the twin-gods, Castor and Pollux,
washed their horses after fighting for Rome in the battle of Lake
Regillus, when they announced to the people that the battle was won.
Similar stories are told by Florus. When the Romans conquered
Perses, king of Macedonia, the twin-gods washed themselves at the
Lake of Juturna; and when they defeated the Tigurini, the gods
were seen to deliver a letter to the prætor in front of their temple.</p>

<p>Juturna was the sister of Turnus, immortalized by Jupiter, and turned
into a fountain, whose waters were used in Vesta's sacrifices, and had
curative powers.</p>

<h4>THE FORNIX FABIUS</h4>

<p>stood between the Temples of Cæsar and Castor; some slight remains
can still be seen. It was erected to Fabius Maximus, the conqueror
of the Allobroges, now Savoy. It was erected <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 121, being the
first triumphal arch in the Forum. The Romans originally called
their triumphal arch <i>fornix</i>, not <i>arcus</i>.</p>

<p>The pseudo-Ascon says it stood before the Temple of Castor. The
inscription was found in the sixteenth century, and is given by
Gruter, ccccvi. 5&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">

<p>Another fragment is given in the Vatican Codex, 3368, 4&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
Q . FABIUS . Q . F . MAXIMUS . AED . CVR . REST.</p>
</div>

<p>Cicero is the first author who speaks of this arch, and he alludes to
it several times. In "Verres" (i. 7) he says: "He (Caius Curio) sees
Verres in the crowd by the Fornix Fabius. He speaks to the man, and
with a loud voice congratulates him on his victory." Asconius, commenting
on this passage, says: "Fornix Fabius arcus est juxta Regiam
in Sacra Via a Fabio censore constructus, qui a devictis Allobrogibus
Allobrox cognominatus est, ibique statua ejus posita propterea est."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>In "Pro Plancio" (vii.) Cicero says: "When I am hustled in a
crowd, and pushed against the Arch of Fabius, I do not complain to
the man who is at the top of the Sacra Via, but to him who pushes
me." Again ("De Orat." ii. 66) he says: "Crassus said in a speech
to the people that Memnius, though himself so great a man, as he
came into the Forum, stooped his head at the Arch of Fabius."</p>

<p>Seneca ("De Constantia Sapientis," i.) says: "Cato was dragged
from the (old) Rostra to the Arch of Fabius"&mdash;that is, nearly the
whole length of the Forum. Trebellius Pollio ("Saloninus Gallienus,"
i. 10) says: "There was at this time at the foot of the hill
Romulus (Palatine) a statue, that is before the Sacred Way, between
the Temples of Faustina and Vesta, near to the Arch of Fabius."
This exactly describes the site.</p>

<p>We have two views of this arch preserved to us on ancient reliefs.
The first, from the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, now on the stairway of
the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitol, represents the arch on
the left of the Temple-Tomb of the deified Cæsar. The second, a
relief on the monument of Marcus Aurelius on the Comitium, nearest
the Arch of Septimius Severus, depicts the Arch of Fabius to the
right of the Temple of Castor and Pollux.</p>

<p><i>Under the bank of earth to the right of Cæsar's Temple-Tomb
stood</i></p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF AUGUSTUS.</h4>

<p>Dion Cassius records (liv. 8) that Augustus built an arch in commemoration
of the Parthian treaty near the Temple-Tomb of Cæsar.
This is borne out by Maii, an interpreter of Virgil ("Æn." viii. 606),
who says the Arch of Augustus was near to the temple of the deified
Julius. The "Mirabilia" mentions it, and gives the same site:
"Templum Minervæ cum arcu conjunctum est ei, nunc autem vocatur
Sanctus Laurentius de Mirandi;" that is, the Temple of Antoninus
Pius and Faustina, now the Church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.
Accordingly, it was on the right of the Temple of Cæsar. Between
it and the Temple of Antoninus the following inscription on marble
was found in 1540&ndash;46:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
SENATVS . POPVLVSQVE . ROMANVS<br />
IMP . CAESARI . DIVI . IVLI . F . COS . QVINCT<br />
COS . DESIGN . SEX . IMP . SEPT<br />
REPVBLICA CONSERVATA.<br />
(Gruter, ccxxvi. 5.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is doubtful whether this refers to the Arch of Augustus or to the
Temple of Cæsar, both having been built by Augustus. A coin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Augustus represents this arch, with the legend, CIVIB . ET . SIGN .
MILIT . A . PART . RECVP. In the early part of 1884, on the Via Sacra,
near the Temple of
Antoninus, some thirty
travertine <i>voussoirs</i>&mdash;which
formed part of
an arch, the diameter
of which was 12 feet 17
inches&mdash;were brought
to light. So far, the excavations
do not show
where this arch stood;
but when the road between
the Temples of
Cæsar and Antoninus
is cut away, we may
hope to find the site.</p>

</div>

<h4>THE ROSTRA JULIA.</h4>

<p>We know from Dion
Cassius that Cæsar encouraged the popular business to be carried on at
the lower end of the Forum, and that he turned the steps of the Temple
of Castor into a temporary rostra. On this becoming popular he
built a new rostra, which was called the plebeian rostra or Rostra Julia.
We learn from Suetonius that it was before
the Temple of Cæsar. Cicero, speaking from
it against Mark Antony, bids his audience
look to the (<i>their</i>) left at the gilt equestrian
statue of Antony which stood before the
Temple of Castor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:166px"><a name="i-077b" id="i-077b"></a>
<img src="images/i-077b.jpg" width="166" height="173" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HADRIAN ADDRESSING THE
PEOPLE FROM THE ROSTRA JULIA.</p>
<a href="images/i-077bl.jpg">View larger image.</a>
</div>

<p>This is one of the most interesting spots
in the Forum. Cæsar built the second
rostra with its rear towards the Forum,
represented by the darker lines in the above
plan. In front, towards the curved edge,
Antony spoke, Cæsar's body being on the
level below. The body was burnt and buried "in the Forum in that
place visible from the old monumental Regia of the Romans. On
the spot was placed an altar <i>where now</i> is the Temple of Cæsar"
(Appian, ii. 42). "The same men were erecting a tomb in the Forum
who had performed that irregular funeral" (Cicero, "First Phil." ii.).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>It was decorated with the rams of the captured ships of Antony
and Cleopatra. It was the custom to speak from the circular edge;
but when the Temple of Cæsar was built, it was erected close up to
his rostra, on the site where the people had previously stood, and so
they had to turn about and address the people from the flat edge.
"As he was seated on the rostra at the festival of Pan, Mark
Antony placed upon his brow a royal diadem" (Velleius Paterculus,
ii. 56).</p>

<h4>MARK ANTONY'S SPEECH.</h4>

<p>When Cæsar was killed, it was not in the Capitol, as Shakespeare
makes it, nor in the Senate House upon the Forum, but in Pompey's
Senate House (see <a href="#Page_195">page 195</a>). From there the body was carried to
his house, and next day into the Forum, on its way to the Campus
Martius, and was placed in front of the Rostra Julia for some friend
to make the funeral oration over it. Mark Antony mounted the
rostra, and there made his famous speech, "which moved the people
to that degree that they immediately burned the body in that very
place, and afterwards interred his ashes" (Dion Cassius, "Cæsar").</p>

<p>Livy ("Epit." xcvi.) says that "Cæsar's body was burned before
the plebeian rostra." Dion Cassius says his temple-tomb was built on
the very spot where his body was burned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Antony's address has not come down to us, so we
must accept Shakespeare's immortal version.</p>

<h4>THE CURTIAN LAKE.</h4>

<p>Crossing the Sacred Way, which passes along the front of Cæsar's
Tomb, we arrive at the space occupied by the shops destroyed in
excavating. The construction remaining shows that they were rebuilt
at a late date. It will be noticed that the soil is damp and sandy.
This spot was once marshy, and took its name from Mettius Curtius, a
leader of the Sabines, getting mired here in the battle which took
place about the carrying off of the women. Plutarch, Livy, Dionysius,
and Ovid agree in this; and not from the fable related by
Livy (vii. 16) of the Forum opening, and Marcus Curtius jumping in,
horse, armour, and all. The former event is commemorated in a
relief in stone now in the Capitol; whilst the latter fable is depicted
in the marble relief now in the Borghese Museum.</p>

<h4>THE PEDESTAL OF THE STATUE OF DOMITIAN.</h4>

<p>The Statue was destroyed by the people after his death, and the base
of the pedestal is all we have left, standing upon the travertine pavement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of the Forum. It is interesting to archæologists as putting to rest
the arguments in reference to the names and positions of the different
buildings in the Forum. The poet Statius ("Silvæ," i. 1, 22) describes
the relative position of the different buildings and this statue. He
tells us that the statue was situated in the middle of the Forum,
near the Curtian Lake. In front of it was the temple of the deified
Julius; behind it were the Temples of Vespasian and Concord; on
one side the Basilica Julia, and on the other the Basilica Æmilia;
whilst the rider looked towards the Temple of Vesta and the Imperial
Palace.</p>

</div>

<p>Suetonius tells us that the tablet inscribed upon the base of
Domitian's triumphal statue was carried away by the violence of a
storm, and fell upon a neighbouring monument.</p>

<p><i>A little beyond this pedestal, to the right</i>, are the remains of another
pedestal, a deep round hole recently closed, and beyond it a third
pedestal.</p>

<p><i>Upon the first we will place</i></p>

<h4>THE STATUE OF MARSYAS.</h4>

<p>Servius informs us that this statue was put up in the principal
forum of every city as an emblem of civic liberty and even-handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
justice. It stood in front of the old rostra. Horace and Martial
both refer to it as being near the judge's seat. It had a pig-skin of
wine on one shoulder, denoting the plentiful supply to the city, and
had the other arm extended with the hand open, showing that every
one should have equal justice.</p>

<p><i>Over the round hole stood</i></p>

<h4>THE PUTEAL SCRIBONIUS LIBO,</h4>

<p>or well altar. This is shown on a coin as being round.</p>

<p>"At a small distance from the statue of Attus, both the hone and
the razor are said to be buried under a certain altar; the place is
called <i>Puteus</i> by the Romans" (Dionysius, iii. 72). Cicero ("De Div."
i. 17) says, "It was on the Comitium, and was erected over the
spot where the hone and razor were buried." (See also Horace, Ep.
i. 19.)</p>

<p><i>Upon the other base we will place</i></p>

<h4>THE STATUE OF ATTUS NAVIUS.</h4>

<p>"Tarquin erected a brazen statue of him in the Forum to eternalize
his memory with posterity. This statue is still remaining, and
stands before the Senate House, near to the holy fig-tree. It is less
than a middle-sized man, and has a veil over the head" (Dionysius,
iii. 72). "The statue of Attus Navius was erected before the Senate
House, the pedestal of which was consumed when the Senate House
itself was burned at the funeral of Publius Clodius" (Pliny, xxxiv. 11).
"There was a statue of Attus, with a fillet on his head, in the place
where Tarquin had the whetstone cut in two with a razor, on the
Comitium, or place of assembly, just by the steps, at the left-hand
side of the Senate House" (Livy, i. 36).</p>

<h4>THE FICUS NAVIA</h4>

<p>was a fig-tree that, according to Festus, was planted by Tarquin in
commemoration of his having had the whetstone cut in two with a
razor, according to the augury of Attus Navius. It should not be
confounded with the Ruminal fig-tree which grew upon the Palatine,
as has been done by some writers. It is rather a curious incident
that since the excavations were made, a fig-tree sprang up near the
pedestal of Marsyas. This is the tree shown on the reliefs of the
monument of Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<p><i>Just beyond these three objects</i>, a semicircular mark on the pavement
points to the site of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<h4>THE ROSTRA.</h4>

<p>The original Rostra was first called the Suggestum or Pulpit, but
in <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 416 the name was changed into Rostra (beaks).</p>

<p>"The prows from the six ships captured from the Antiates were
ordered to be placed as decorations on the Suggestum in the
Forum, which was hence called Rostra" (Livy, viii. 14; Florus, i. 11;
Pliny, xxiv. 11).</p>

<p>"The Rostra stood on the Comitium in front of the Curia" (Varro),
from which the orators harangued the people assembled in the open
air; and it was evidently only a temporary structure, probably of
wood, and not a building like the other two Rostra. It stood upon
a circular basement, but the top was square; on the outside were
fixed the brazen beaks which belonged to the captive vessels of the
Antiates. About the Rostra were placed the statues of the ambassadors
put to death by Lar Tolumnius, king of Veii, and others
who suffered on similar occasions; the three Fates, Horatius Cocles,
Camillus, Hercules, the father of Vitellius, and others who deserved
well of their country.</p>

<p>"When Caius Gracchus brought in his bill to regulate the courts
of judicature, there was one thing very remarkable: whereas the orators
before him, in all addresses to the people, stood with their faces towards
the Senate House and the Comitium, he then, for the first time,
turned the other way,&mdash;that is to say, towards the Forum,&mdash;and continued
to speak in that position ever after. By this he intimated that
the people ought to be addressed, and not the senate" (Plutarch).</p>

<p>Suetonius tells us that on the death of Augustus "two funeral
orations were pronounced in his praise, one before the Temple of
Julius by Tiberius, and the other before the Rostra, under the old
shops, by Drusus." Some read this passage, "from the old Rostra;"
but our rendering is more correct, though in either case he is referring
to the Rostra that stood in front of the Curia.</p>

<p>The first time Cicero spoke from the Rostra was when he delivered
his oration for the Manilian Law, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 687, when in his forty-first
year. After his assassination, the head and hands of Cicero were
placed upon this Rostra, from where he had so often addressed the
Romans&mdash;"that very Rostra, which he had made his own; nor was
there a less concourse to see him there than had formerly been to
hear him" (Florus, iv. 6). "That everybody might see them in the
very place where he had formerly harangued with so much vehemence"
(Dion Cassius, "Augustus").

<p class="caption">THE ROSTRA.</p>
</div>

<p>The form of this Rostra is preserved to us, being represented on a
coin.</p>

<p>There is an important passage in Pliny which shows the exact site
of the Rostra, as it was used to mark the hour of noon. When the
summoner caught sight of the sun passing
the edge of the Rostra, he declared the
hour of noon. A man standing on this site
will roughly represent the Rostra, and as
the gun fires at mid-day the edge of the
sun can be seen coming past him by a person
standing by the pedestal at the bank
in front of S. Adriano, who will roughly
represent the summoner. We have tried
this numerous times with our audience,
and it is the only spot on the Forum
where it answers.</p>

<p>"The <i>accensus</i> of the consuls proclaiming mid-day aloud, as soon
as, from the Senate House, he caught sight of the sun between the
Rostra and the Græcostasis: he also proclaimed the last hour, when the
sun had gone off the Mænian Column to the Prison" (Pliny, vii. 60).</p>

<p>In excavating the open space of the Comitium upon the Forum
in the summer of 1872, an interesting discovery was made of two
marble screens or balustrades sculptured on each side, the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
being some historic scene, the other representing animals. At the
time, and since their discovery, many suggestions have been offered
as to their signification and use, but none seemed satisfactory, at
least to us. After considerable thought, examination of the ground,
and putting this and that together, we have arrived at an estimate of
their use and meaning entirely different from the hitherto received
opinion; in which we are supported by their construction and the
classic passages relating to them. They are <i>in situ</i> as found, but a
new piece of marble has been put under them.</p>

<p>From this it will be seen that we have made an important discovery
bearing upon the topography of the Forum, which will be of
interest not only to classical students, but to every one interested in
the word Rome.</p>

<p>We have discovered that the reliefs on the screens upon the Comitium
in the Forum portray scenes from the life of Marcus Aurelius,
showing in their backgrounds the buildings occupying two sides of the
Forum&mdash;from the Temple of Concord to the Arch of Fabius&mdash;and
that these marble balustrades led up to the statue of that emperor.
The space where it stood can be plainly traced upon the pavement;
and that is why these pictures refer to epochs of his life. The statue
is still existing, and now stands in the square of the Capitol, where it
was erected by Michael Angelo, who brought it from the Lateran in
1538, where it had been placed about 1187, when it was removed from
the Forum, near the Column of Phocas, where it had long been looked
upon as a statue of Constantine, and is so called in the Regiona
Catalogue; hence its preservation.</p>

<p>The whole group was evidently erected in honour of Marcus
Aurelius, and in commemoration of the important events in his life
depicted on the screens, as recorded by Dion Cassius.</p>

<p>The first relief represents a scene upon the Forum between the old
Rostra Marsyas and the fig-tree&mdash;burning the forty-six years' arrears
of debts which Marcus Aurelius had forgiven the people.</p>

<p>"After that he remitted all that had been due to the Public
and Imperial Treasuries for the course of forty-six years, without
including therein Hadrian's reign, and ordered all the papers
of claims to be burned in the Forum" (Dion Cassius, "Marcus
Aurelius").</p>

<p>This was on the marriage of his son Commodus with Crispina.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the relief is to the right of the fig-tree and
Marsyas. Now, if we go round to the other relief, we have the same
tree and Marsyas in the same relative positions; but the relief is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the left, and the scenes are taking place between the Rostra Julia,
the fig-tree, and Marsyas:&mdash;</p>

<p>Giving the donation of eight pieces of gold.</p>

<p>Roma, or perhaps Faustina, thanking him for the Puellæ Faustinianæ.</p>

<p>"After he had come back to Rome, as he was one day haranguing
the people, and speaking of the number of years he had spent abroad
in his expeditions, the citizens with a loud voice cried out, 'Eight,' at
the same time extending their hands to receive as many pieces of
gold. The emperor, smiling, repeated, 'Eight,' and ordered every
Roman eight pieces, which was so considerable a sum, that so great
a one was never given before by any emperor" (Dion Cassius,
"Marcus Aurelius").</p>

<p>It will be noticed that two men are holding up their hands with
fingers extended, one five, the other three&mdash;eight.</p>

<p>The other scene on this relief represents a female figure advancing
to the seated figure of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, leading a child
and carrying another, to thank him for the orphan schools he founded
in Rome in memory of his wife after her death, and which he named
after her. "New Faustinian schools he instituted in honour of his
dead wife" (Julius Capitolinus, "M. Antoninus," xxvi.).</p>

<h4>THE SUOVETAURILIA.</h4>

<p>Upon the inner sides of the Avenue are represented on each balustrade
a boar, a ram, and a bull&mdash;the animals offered at the triple
sacrifice, or <i>suovetaurilia</i> (from <i>sus</i>, <i>ovis</i>, <i>taurus</i>), which was performed
once every five years, or <i>lustrum</i>, for the purification of the city.</p>

<p>It was an institution of Servius Tullius, the ceremony consisting
in leading the boar, ram, and bull thrice round the assembly of the
people, and then offering them to Mars. There is a similar representation
upon a relief of Trajan on the Arch of Constantine, and
upon a pedestal found near the Arch of Septimius Severus.</p>

<p><i>To our left of the Arch of Severus is</i></p>

<h4>THE ROSTRA AD PALMAM.</h4>

<p>Neither the position nor the construction of this Rostra answers to
that of the original Suggestum, which took the name of Rostra from
having fixed on it the <i>six</i> bronze beaks of the Antiates' ships. The
original Rostra, shown on a coin of Palikanus, the orator mentioned
by Cicero ("Brutus," lxii.)&mdash;see page 42&mdash;was a wooden pulpit. Its
exact site we have already identified. The last historical notice that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
we have of it is in Spartianus's "Life of Didius Julianus" (iv.), <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
193. After saying that the emperor addressed the Senate, he adds,
"but the people expressly in the Rostra before the Curia."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-085" id="i-085"></a>
<img src="images/i-085.jpg" width="324" height="293" alt="" /><br />
<a href="images/i-085l.jpg">View larger image.</a>
</div>

<p>Under the Empire the Rostra had lost its use, and only served
occasionally for the emperor to address the people from, or for reading
out edicts and proclamations. The western end of the Forum
saw many changes after the fire under Commodus, and was rearranged
under Septimius Severus, who restored the old edifices, retaining the
names of the founders, and erected others (Spartianus, "Severus,"
xxiii.). In 203 an arch was erected to Severus and his two sons, and
a new Rostra was made on the south side of this arch. By cutting
away a piece of the slope of the Capitoline Hill, he formed an escarpment
11 feet high, which was faced with a curved brick wall, and
cased with Porta Santa marble, in panels 3 feet 1 inch wide. Between
each pair of panels there is a space 6½ inches wide, from which a
piece of marble jutted out 3½ inches. Only one of these exists. On
it there was fixed a bronze beak, probably made in imitation of the
old ones, for in that day they had no naval foes from whom to capture
ships. If there was one row only, there were eighteen in all;
if two rows, thirty-six. This in itself is sufficient to show the ridiculousness
of calling this the original Rostra, which had six beaks only.
The peculiar marble casing also shows late work. At the north end
of this platform was erected the Umbilicus (<span class="smcap">E</span>), and on the south end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
was placed the Milliarium Aureum (<span class="smcap">F</span>). From the level space on the
top of this escarpment the orator would speak; whilst at a short
distance in his rear was the street Clivus Argentarius, leading from
the Via Sacra to the Porta Rutuminia. This Rostra was popularly
known as the People's Rostra, because from it they were addressed&mdash;"Deinde
ad Rostra Populum convocarunt" (Capitolinus, "Maximus
et Balbinus," iii.). The narrowness of the level space on the top of
this Rostra caused great inconvenience; and as room could not be
gained in the rear, it had to be taken in front, encroaching on the
Comitium. Forty-three and a half feet in front of the curved wall of
Porta Santa a straight wall was built of travertine and tufa, 78 feet
long, with side walls from it back to the extreme ends of the Rostra,
and this was cased with Carrara white marble, the space between the
two walls being filled with earth, thus making a large platform with
a square instead of a curved front. The blocks of tufa and marble
were tied together by iron clamps, of which fragments remain, of a
shape not used in the earlier days, but used now. <img src="images/i-086.jpg" width="42" height="20" alt="" /> That the
curved wall and the straight wall are not contemporary is shown by
the construction, as well as by the fact that the curved wall is faced
with coloured marble, which would not have been the case if it had
not at one time been open to the Forum. The curved wall is on a
line with the Arch of Severus; but the tufa wall comes out 25½ feet
beyond the arch, and is not parallel with the curved wall behind it.
The tufa and travertine wall is erected on the travertine pavement of
the Comitium.</p>

<p>We believe these changes on this Rostra were made in the time of
Aurelian (270), after the death of Claudius II., whose statue was
erected on this Rostra. "Illi totius orbis judicio in rostris posita est
columna palmata statua superfixa" (Pollio, "Claudius," iii.). Upon
this Rostra also Aurelian erected a statue of the Genius of the Roman
People. Aurelianus&mdash;"Genium Populi Romani in rostra posuit"
("E Chronicis antiquis excerpta Aurelianus"). The fourth century
guides, "Curiosum Urbis" and "De Regionibus" (in Regio viii.),
mention the Genium Populi Romani, the latter adding "aureum."
They both mention three Rostra in the Forum. The statue of
Claudius was not represented as wearing the Roman toga, but the
Greek pallium, from which this Rostra became known as the Rostra
ad Palmam; and this part of the Forum in later times was called ad
Palmam.</p>

<p>Theodoric&mdash;"Deinde veniens ingressus urbem venit ad Senatum,
et ad Palmam populo adlocutus" ("Excerpta Valesiana," lxvi.).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Ligaverunt ei manus a tergo et decollaverunt
extra Capitolium et extrahentes
jactaverunt eum juxta arcum triumphi ad
Palmam" ("Acta SS., Mai." vii.).</p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus (xvi. x. 13) describes
Constantius's visit in 356 to this
Rostra: "When he arrived at the Rostra,
he gazed with amazed awe on the Forum,
the most renowned monument of ancient
power; and being bewildered with the
number of wonders on every side to which
he turned his eyes, having addressed the
nobles in the Senate House and harangued
the populace from the Rostra, he retired."
This expresses the feelings of many visitors
in our day. The site commands a good
view of the Forum.</p>

<p class="caption">RELIEF FROM THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE REPRESENTING THE ROSTRA AD PALMAM, ETC.<br />
<a href="images/i-087l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The remains of this Rostra are best illustrated
by the representation of it in the
relief on the Arch of Constantine; and by
no possible imagination can it be made to
agree with the coin of Palikanus.</p>

<p>In the centre is a platform with a straight
front, having a lattice balustrade; on the
right is a statue of Claudius II., and on the
left the statue of the Genius of Rome. A
group of people stand behind the railing
and surround Constantine, who is addressing
the people. Behind are five Corinthian
columns surmounted with statues. The
balustrade stood on the top of the tufa
wall, and some of the fallen gray granite
columns still exist. To our right, clear of
the Rostra, is the Arch of Severus, a group
of people being in front, looking up to the
Rostra. On the left, in the background, are
the Arch of Tiberius, spanning the Vicus
Jugarius, and four of the arches of the
Basilica Julia&mdash;the foreground being occupied
by a crowd of people facing towards
the Rostra.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>The scene here depicted was no doubt that which took place on
the entry of Constantine into Rome: "And with a loud voice and
by inscriptions he made known to all men the salutary standard"
(Eusebius, "Life of Constantine," xl.).</p>

<p>In the relief the head of Constantine is unfortunately missing; but
it seems very appropriate that he should be represented addressing
the Roman people from that Rostra, which was decorated with the
statue of his ancestor Claudius II.</p>

<p>There are no beaks shown on the relief; but along the tufa wall,
at regular intervals of 3 feet 4 inches, are cut grooves 6½ inches wide
and 1½ inch deep: in these grooves are holes which, if they were to
sustain beaks, would give thirty-six for a single row, and seventy-two
for a double row.</p>

<p>We doubt if these grooves and holes were for beaks. They were
more probably for the supports of the marble casing; they do not go
completely through the wall.</p>

<p>Some authorities call these remains on the Clivus the Rostra
Vetera, or the original Rostra. But it does not answer classic
description, and the construction shows it to be of late date. It
does not stand <i>on</i> the Comitium, or <i>before</i> the Curia, nor <i>under</i>
the old shops. Besides, it looks down the Forum; so from here
how could Gracchus have <i>turned</i> from the Senate House and Comitium
towards the Forum?</p>

<h4>THE UMBILICUS</h4>

<p>was a monument marking the centre of the Roman world. The ruin
of the Umbilicus is at the side of the Arch of Septimius Severus, at
the end of the Rostra ad Palmam. Its pyramidal shape upon a round
base can easily be distinguished.</p>

<h4>THE ASYLUM OF ROMULUS.</h4>

<p>This was between the Clivus Capitolinus and the Pass of the Two
Groves (Via Arco di Septimo Severo), under the Capitoline Hill, and
served afterwards as an advanced fort to the citadel. "He opened a
sanctuary, in the place where the enclosure now is, on the road down
from the Capitoline [Temple], called the Pass of the Two Groves"
(Livy, i. 8). "He surrounded it with a high stone wall" (Ovid, "Fasti,"
iii. 231). The gate leading into it was called the Porta Pandana&mdash;"ever-open
gate" (Solinus, i. 13. See Plutarch, in "Romulus;" Dionysius,
ii. 15; Florus, i. 1; Varro and Festus). The remains of the tufa
wall exist on the left of the Clivus, in front of the Temple of Saturn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CLOACA MAXIMA,</h4>

<p>or great drain, begun by Tarquin the Great, containing a large stream
of water rushing along, as it did over two thousand years ago, is
exposed to view at the east end of the Basilica Julia.</p>

<p>It was finished by Tarquin the Proud, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 556 (Livy, i. 38, 55).</p>

<p>"Men spoke in admiration of the public sewers, too, a work more
stupendous than any, as mountains had to be pierced for their construction,
and navigation might be carried on beneath Rome; an
event which happened in the ædileship of M. Agrippa, after he had
filled the office of consul." (See Dion Cassius, "Augustus,"
<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 721.)</p>

<p>"For this purpose there are seven streams turned into the artificial
channels, and flowing beneath the city. Rushing onward, like so
many impetuous torrents, they are compelled to carry off and sweep
away all the sewerage" (Pliny, xxxvi. 24).</p>

<h4>FRAGMENTS</h4>

<p>of different buildings lie scattered about; to what edifices they belonged
"pronounce who can." More than two hundred columns,
and fifty capitals of exquisite workmanship, have been discovered in
the excavations of the Forum. Near the reliefs on the Comitium is
a pedestal with the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
TO THE ANNIHILATOR OF TYRANTS,<br />
AND THE AUTHOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY,<br />
TO OUR CONSTANT AND FELICITOUS LORD,<br />
ARCADIUS AUGUSTUS.<br />
ALBINUS, PREFECT OF THE CITY, ETC.,<br />
HAS ERECTED THIS.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Having now made the circuit of the Forum, we will proceed to</i></p>

<h4>THE SCALÆ ANNULARIÆ.</h4>

<p>Beyond the Temple of Castor, to the right of the Temple of Vesta,
are remains of these stairs.</p>

<p>"Augustus lived at first near the Roman Forum, above the Ringmaker's
Stairs, in a house which had once been occupied by Calvus
the orator" (Suetonius, "Augustus," lxxii.). Calvus the orator, a
friend of Cicero, lived on the Palatine; and the Scalæ Annulariæ was
a flight of stairs that led from the east end of the Forum up the north
side of the Palatine to the Clivus Victoriæ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>On the 12th of April 1882, a piece of the marble plan was found
here which, curiously enough, represents this part of the Forum,
showing the side of the Temple of Castor and the Ringmaker's Stairs.</p>

<h4>HOUSE OF THE VIRGINS.</h4>

<p>Between the Temple of Vesta and the Sacra Via was the original
dwelling-place of the Vestals, of which little remains beyond tufa
walls beneath the more recent level. These walls were again exposed
to view in some excavations made in the spring of 1886. They are
marked in black on our Plan (<a href="#i-101">page 61</a>), being now again covered up.</p>

<p>Martial (i. 70), in addressing his book which he sends to Proculus,
says, "You will pass by the Temple of Castor, near that of ancient
Vesta, and that goddess's virgin home."</p>

<p>Dionysius (ii. 67) says: "They live near by the temple of the
goddess."</p>

<h4>VESTA'S DUST-BIN.</h4>

<p>By the side of the temple is a pit four feet square, where the ashes
and sweepings of the temple were deposited; which were cleared out
on the 15th of June, and thrown down the Porta Stercoraria, on the
Clivus Capitolinus, into the Cloaca. (Ovid, "F." vi. 237, 712; Varro,
"L. L." v.; Festus.)</p>

<h4>THE SHRINE OF MERCURY.</h4>

<p>Beyond the Temple of Vesta, on the right, is a small brick shrine.
The base of the statue of this shrine was fortunately found telling us
the name.</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
DIO<br />
MERCVRIO</p>
</div>

<p>On the flank of the base is another inscription, giving us the date of
its erection, April 26, 275 <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The brick podium of the shrine was cased with marble, one piece,
one foot four inches high, being <i>in situ</i> on the side towards the steps.
It supported an entablature of Carrara marble formed by two half-columns
at the rear and two columns in front, of the fluted composite
order. On the frieze is the inscription, in beautifully cut letters five
inches high, recording its erection by the Roman senate and people&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
SENATVS . POPVLVSQVE . ROMANVS<br />
PECVNIA . PVBLICA . FACIENDAM . CVRAVIT.</p>
</div>
<p>The podium is 4 feet 7 inches high, 9 feet 9 inches wide, 8 feet 2
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
inches deep. The fragments found are to be built up in their original
sites, and so the shrine will be preserved. It was originally erected
by Antoninus Pius, and is represented on a bronze coin of his&mdash;the
pediment being supported by four Hermes (the Greek name for Mercury)
busts. In the tympanum are the tortoise, cock, ram, winged
cap, caduceus, and the magic purse. When it was restored in the
consulship of Aurelian and Marcellino, columns and composite capitals
took the place of the Hermes busts.</p>

<p><i>The travertine steps by the side of the Shrine of Mercury led into</i></p>

<h4>THE ATRIUM VESTÆ.</h4>

<p>After the destructive fire of 192, the Forum and edifices on the
Sacra Clivus were rebuilt by Septimius Severus and Julia Domna
(Spartianus, Dion Cassius, Eutropius), the empress taking upon herself
the special work of rebuilding the temple and residence of the Vestal
Virgins; and although the original podium of the temple was used,
it was considerably raised by rubble being placed on the top of the
ancient tufa platform. This was necessary owing to the raising of
the level from <i>débris</i>.</p>

<p>For the Atrium Vestæ a different site was selected, more to the
south under the Palatine; in fact the whole disposition of the edifices
about here was changed, as proved by comparing the earlier with the
later classical notices, and the excavations of 1883&ndash;4.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i-091" id="i-091"></a>
<img src="images/i-091.jpg" width="155" height="162" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DEDICATION OF THE TEMPLE.<br />
<a href="images/i-091l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>
<p>To commemorate this rebuilding a silver coin was struck by the empress,
bearing her head on the obverse; and
on the reverse is the Temple of Vesta in
the background, in front of which stands
an altar, and on either side are three virgins,
two of whom are pouring an oblation
over the altar.</p>

<p>This new arrangement of the buildings
is thus exactly described by Servius (in
"Æn." vii. 153): "By the Temple of Vesta
was the Regia of Numa Pompilius, but
near to the Atrium of Vesta, which was
distinct from the temple."</p>

<p>Standing just inside, at the top of the steps, we have the whole
Atrium Vestæ, as their residence was named, uncovered before us&mdash;a
large peristylium paved with black and white mosaic, 222 feet
long by 76 feet wide. Standing out thirteen feet from the boundary
wall of the Atrium, and extending all round the court, were forty-four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
columns of various marbles, whilst under the colonnade were the
pedestals bearing honorary inscriptions and statues of High Vestals:
sixteen on each side, six at the top, and six at the bottom. Of these,
thirteen honorary inscriptions have been found dedicated to six different
High Vestal Virgins, the Lady Superiors of the nunnery.
Four slight fragments of other inscriptions were also found, making
seventeen in all. Twelve of the statues, more or less perfect, have
also been found: likewise an honorary pedestal to Caracalla; and a
statue to Vettius Agorius Prætextatus, erected to this champion of
paganism, 367 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, by C&oelig;lia Concordia, the last of the High Vestal
Virgins.</p>

<p>At the east end of the Atrium is the fountain, beyond which is a
step up on to a tesselated pavement, and from that four steps lead
into the tabularium, or reception-room, having on each side three
chambers, in which most probably the Vestals deposited those objects
intrusted to their sacred keeping.</p>

<p>On each side of the Atrium were the residential chambers of the
High Vestals, the simple Virgins, and their domestics, two stories
high. Those on the south side are best preserved.</p>

<p>From the tesselated pavement a door gives access into a corridor,
once paved with white and black mosaic; at the end, on the left, is
a bath-chamber; and opening out from the corridor are several
chambers showing traces of marble pavements, frescoed and marble-cased
walls. In the second chamber are the remains of the mill for
grinding the salt used in sacrifice. (See Virgil, "Buc." viii. 82;
Horace, "O." iii. 23; Festus.) Pliny (xxxi. 41) says, "It is in our
sacred rites more particularly that the high importance of salt is to
be recognized, no offering ever being made unaccompanied by crushed
salt."</p>

<p>This corridor does not run the whole length of the Atrium, but
turns off to a flight of stairs leading to the upper chambers. The
remainder of the chambers on this side were reached direct from the
Atrium by steps. The first one contains a hexagonal pedestal to
Flavia Publicia. From the marble and fresco decorations found here,
these rooms were most probably the apartment of the High Vestal
Virgin.</p>

<p>The inscriptions to the High Vestals found, date between 180 and
364 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and were erected in return for some advantage derived
from the patronage of the High Vestal. Historically they are of no
great importance, giving us only names of Vestals that were already
known. The most important inscriptions are those found here which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
do not refer to the Virgins. Commencing with the first pedestal at
the top of the entry steps, they read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Flavia Publicia. Erected July 9, 283 <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Concordiæ. Dedicated June 9, 364. She was the last High Vestal,
and her name was erased because she became a Christian.</p>

<p>Statue of Vettius Agorius Prætextatus. 380.</p>

<p>Fragment of a seated statue.</p>

<p>Statue unknown.</p>

<p>Statue and pedestal to Flavia Publicia.</p>

<p>This part of the city was finally destroyed by the great fire, when
Robert Guiscard burned Rome from the Lateran to the Capitol, in
1084. During this long period of nearly seven hundred years the
Atrium Vestæ underwent many changes and received other tenants,
for the new excavations show that it had been inhabited after the
Vestals were abolished.</p>

<p>At the rear of the first pedestal a terra-cotta jar was discovered,
containing a brooch bearing the name of Pope Martin III., 943&ndash;46;
a gold coin of the Eastern Emperor Theophilus (827&ndash;42); and eight
hundred and thirty Anglo-Saxon silver coins of Alfred the Great
(871&ndash;900), Edward (900&ndash;24), Edgar Athelstan (925&ndash;41), and Edmund
I. (941&ndash;48)&mdash;four kings of Northumbria&mdash;and of Plegmund, Archbishop
of Canterbury (889&ndash;923). We may presume that this money
was brought to Rome by some English tourist, who left his all and
fled when the building was finally destroyed by fire; or that it formed
part of a donation of "Peter's Pence." Ethelwulf, the English king
during the time of Leo IV. (845&ndash;57), was the first English prince
who gave tribute to the See of Rome; and as such his portrait is to
be seen in <i>chiaro-oscuro</i>, by Caravaggio, in the Stanze of the Incendio
del Borgo in the Vatican.</p>

<p>After running a course of one thousand and eighty years, Gratian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
in 367 "refused the office of Pontifex Maximus, and abolished the
functions of the Vestal Virgins" (Zosimus, iv.), which were finally
suppressed by Theodosius in 392. "Theodosius directed his attention
towards the suppression of idolatry, and issued a law commanding
the demolition of idolatrous temples." "The faithful emperor
Theodosius interdicted these rites and consigned them to disuse"
(Theodoret, v. 21).</p>

<p>The Bishop of Rome and his clergy came by right, as heads of the
established religion, into the possessions of the defunct faiths, and
inhabited the quarters of the Vestals, assuming the title of the head of
the ancient religion, Pontifex Maximus, a title held to the present day&mdash;a
dignity two thousand six hundred and forty years old, the oldest
title in the world.</p>

<h4>THE PALLADIUM.</h4>

<p>In the centre of the peristylium, just coming to the surface and
occupying the whole of the width of the open court, are the foundations
of an octagonal edifice in brick, with ribs running from the
angles to a central circle. Here, doubtless, was the shrine in which
was kept the Sacred Palladium, or fatal token of the empire of the
Romans. "Fatale pignus imperii Romani" (Livy, xxvi. 27). "Kept
under the safeguard of Vesta's temple" (<i>ibid.</i> v. 52). This was a
statuette of "Minerva, by no male beheld" (Lucan, ix. 994). "The
Vestals alone were permitted to behold the Trojan Minerva" (<i>ibid.</i> i.
598). "That fell from heaven" (Dionysius, ii. 67). It seems it was
originally kept in the Temple of Vesta itself (Pliny, vii. 45; Ovid,
"T." iii. 1, 39).</p>

<p>"The sacred image of Minerva, to which the Romans pay uncommon
veneration, and which, as they say, was brought from Troy, was
exposed to public view (during the fire of 192), so that the men of
our age beheld the Palladium, never seen by any before since the
time it came from Ilium into Italy. For the Vestal Virgins laid
hold on it in the hurry and confusion, and carried it openly through
the Sacred Way into the Imperial Palace" (Herodian, in "Commodus").</p>

<p>"Elagabalus, wanting a wife for his sun-god, sent for the sacred
image of Pallas, which the Romans worship in secret from human
eyes, and had it brought into his own bed-room. Thus he dared to
displace the Palladium, that had never been moved since the time it
came from Ilium, except when the temple was destroyed by fire, and
they conveyed the goddess into the Imperial Palace" (<i>ibid.</i> in "Antoninus;"
Lampridius, in "Elagabalus," iii.).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>Fragments of a statuette of Minerva were found in the excavations.</p>

<h4>THE VICUS VESTÆ.</h4>

<p>From the Via Sacra, above the Arch of Titus, a street, passing
along a ledge on the northern side of the Palatine, runs into
the Vicus Tuscus at the back of the Temple of Castor. This was
the street of the Vestals, separating their house from the Imperial
Palace. Asconius ("ad Ciceronem pro Scauro,") speaks of it.</p>

<p>We now cross over to the Sacred Way.</p>

<p><i>The first object that attracts our attention is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF SS. COSMO AND DAMIANO,</h4>

<p><i>on the left</i>, occupying the site and built out of the remains of two
temples by Felix IV., 527 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> The subterranean church contains a
spring said to have been called forth by S. Felix. Upon the apse of
the upper church is a mosaic of the time of Felix.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF ROMULUS,</h4>

<p>son of Maxentius, forms the vestibule of the present church. It was
a circular building, and fronted towards the Via Sacra. The second
temple Felix made into the nave of the church; it was quadrangular,
and built of brick, but the western wall was of blocks of Gabii stone,
forming part of the second wall of Rome, which was here utilized for
the temple. It is thirty feet in diameter, and was erected in 302
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> Ligorio ("Vatican Codex," 3439) has preserved the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc"><p>
IMP . CAES . AUGUSTUS . MAXIMUS . TRIUMPH<br />
PIUS . FELIX . AUGUSTUS.</p>
</div>

<p>The two porphyry columns and the cornice belong to the temple; but
the bronze doors are Etruscan, having been sent from Perugia by
Urban VIII. in 1630. The wings on either side of the doorway
were added in 772&ndash;95 by Hadrian I.; the niches, which still show
traces of frescoing, being for relics of the saints. At the same time
the present flooring of the church was inserted some feet above the
ancient level.</p>

<p><i>On the left are slight remains of</i></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF VICAPORTA, VICTORY.</h4>

<div class="figright"><a name="i-097a" id="i-097a"></a>
<img src="images/i-097a.jpg" width="81" height="59" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Remains of this temple have been discovered in the recent excavations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
on the Sacra Via, between the Temple of Antoninus Pius and
the Temple of Romulus. From the slight remains found, it seems
that three of its sides were formed by deep apses, the
fourth side fronting towards the Via Sacra, and entered
by a portico.</p>

<p>Dionysius (v. 19), Plutarch in "Publicola," and Livy
(ii. 7) record that Publius Valerius, surnamed Publicola, built a house
on the Velia overlooking the Forum; but owing to the invidious remarks
made he pulled the house down, and re-erected it at the foot of
the Velia. Plutarch adds, "upon the spot where the Temple of Victory
now stands." Livy also says, "The house was built at the foot of
the hill where the Temple of Victory now stands." Dionysius (v. 48)
says, after speaking of the poverty of Publicola, "The senate decreed
that he should be buried at the expense of the public, and appointed
a place in the city, under the hill called Velia, near the Forum, where
his body was burnt and buried."</p>

<p>This Temple of Victory was dedicated, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 295, by the consul
Lucius Postumus. "He dedicated the Temple of Victory, for the
building of which he had provided, when curule ædile, out of the
money arising from fines" (Livy, x. 33).</p>

<p>This temple is represented on a coin of Gordianus III., 240 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>,
who restored it after his Persian victories.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF VENUS AND ROMA,</h4>

<p>erected by Hadrian in 134 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> It was the largest and most
sumptuous in Rome. It was designed by Hadrian himself, who
sent the drawings to the celebrated architect Apollodorus, whom
he had banished, to ask his opinion. He replied, "That Hadrian
ought to have made it more lofty, and with subterraneous
accommodation for receiving, as occasion might require, the
machinery of the theatre, and for giving it a more imposing
aspect towards the Via Sacra. That as to the statues, they were
so disproportionate, that if the goddesses desired to get up and
walk out, they would not be able" (Dion Cassius; Xiphilinus,
"Hadrian").</p>

<p>For this criticism Apollodorus lost his head; and we learn that the
temple was <i>not</i> on a lofty platform, that there were <i>no</i> subterranean
chambers, and that it was <i>not</i> imposing towards the Via Sacra. The
front was towards the Forum of Peace. What is now the back of
the church, in a stone-cutter's yard, was originally the front of the
temple. It is mentioned by Prudentius as being in the vicinity of
the Via Sacra.</p>

<p>"The Sacred Way resounded (<i>they say</i>) with lowings before the
shrine of Rome; for she also herself is worshipped with blood after
the fashion of a goddess, and the name of the place (<i>Rome</i>) is
regarded as a divinity. The temples also of the city and of Venus
rise with a like roof; and at one and the same time frankincense is
consumed to the twin-gods."</p>

<p>It could not have faced the Via Sacra, or Maxentius would not
have built the temple of his son against it, 311 <span class="s08">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The bronze doors of the Round Temple were found at Perugia by
Urban VIII. The two columns of porphyry, with the cornice, are
supposed to have been found amongst the ruins when it was turned
into a church. On the right side of the present church is a piece
of wall of Gabii tufa stone of <i>opus quadratum</i>. At the back of
the church is the brick front wall of the temple, on which the celebrated
<i>Pianta Capitolina</i> was originally attached (see <a href="#Page_185">page 185</a>)
by means of cement and cramps, and which was found below
the soil under the wall, having been thrown down by an earthquake.</p>

<p>Suetonius tells us that Nero's colossus stood in the vestibule of his
palace.</p>

<p>Martial says, "It was removed by Vespasian, when he built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the Temple of Peace, to where the atrium (a more inward part)
was."</p>

<p>It was a second time removed, for Spartianus informs us that
"Hadrian removed it with twenty-four elephants <i>from</i> the place
where now stands the Temple of the City."</p>

<p>Thus we learn that the spot where the Temple of Rome is, was
formerly the atrium of Nero's Golden House, and that the Temple of
Peace occupied the vestibule.</p>

<p>"Maxentius restored the Temple of Venus and Rome, which had
been damaged by fire" (Aur. Victor, "Cæs." xl.).</p>

<p>The Emperor Heraclius gave permission to Pope Honorius I. to
remove the bronze tiles of this temple in order to use them for
the roof of S. Peter's; whence they were stolen by the Saracens
in 846.</p>

<p>Dion Cassius (lxxi. 31) tells us that "Cleopatra's statue in gold is to
be seen in the Temple of Venus to this day." Also that "the senate
ordered two statues of silver to be erected in the Temple of Venus;
one in honour of Faustina, and the other in honour of the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius. They likewise ordered an altar to be set up
before it, on which every contracted couple were to sacrifice before
marriage."</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Parker, C.B., made some excavations under the wall of
Gabii stone in 1868&ndash;9, and found that a street ran from the Sacred
Way along the side of the wall, in which was a small doorway into
the temple. This has now been re-excavated by the Government
(1880), who have taken possession of the Round Temple.</p>

<p>The government have recently pulled down the chapel of the
burial society adjoining the Temple of Romulus, and on the two
thousand six hundred and thirty-third anniversary of the foundation
of Rome, April 21st, 1880, the two cipollino columns were found to
have belonged to the</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF THE PENATES.</h4>

<p>As the Lares were the departed spirits of the ancestors of each
family who watched over their descendants, so the Penates were the
gods selected by each family as its special protectors. And as there
were the Lares of the city, so there were the Penates, whose chapel
was termed Ædes Deum Penatium, and the gods were called Penates
Populi Romani. These Penates were supposed to have been the
gods brought from Troy by Æneas.</p>

<p>We learn from the "Monumentum Ancyranum," that Augustus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
rebuilt the Ædem Deum Penatium in Velia; and Solinus (i.) tells us
that Tullus Hostilius lived on the Velia, where afterwards was the
Chapel of the Penates. Dionysius thus describes it:&mdash;"For the
things which I myself know, by having seen them, and concerning
which no scruple forbids me to write, are as follows. They show
you a temple at Rome, not far from the Forum, in the street
that leads the nearest way to the Carinæ, which is small, and
darkened by the height of the adjacent buildings. This place is
called by the Romans, in their own language, <i>Veliæ</i>; in this temple
are the images of the Trojan gods exposed to public view, with this
inscription, ΔΕΜΑΣ, which signifies Penates. For, in my opinion,
the letter θ not being yet found out, the ancients expressed its
power by the letter Δ. These are two youths, in a sitting posture,
each of them holding a spear; they are pieces of ancient workmanship"
(Dionysius, i. 68).</p>

<h5>THE RECENT EXCAVATIONS.</h5>

<p>In the new excavations upon the line of the Via Sacra a monumental
cippus has been found, with the following inscription,&mdash;<span class="smcap">FABIUS.
TITIANUS.&mdash;V. C. CONSUL.&mdash;PRAEF. URBI.&mdash;CURAVIT</span>.</p>

<p>He was consul and prefect of the city, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 339 to 341, under the
Emperor Constans I. This was one of three bases recorded as having
stood in front of the Temple of Romulus in the sixteenth century,
one of which is in the Museum of the Villa Borghese, and the
other is in the Naples Museum.</p>

<p>Another base was found, dedicated to the Emperor Constantius II.
by Flavius Leontius, prefect of Rome in 356 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> This is similar to
the one in the Capitoline Museum.</p>

<p>The inscription reads,&mdash;<span class="smcap">TOTO. ORBE. VICTORI.&mdash;DN. CONSTANTIO.
MAX.&mdash;TRIUMFATORI.&mdash;SEMPER. AUG.&mdash;FL. LEONTIUS. V. C.&mdash;PRAEF.
URBI. ITERUM.&mdash;VICE. SACRA. INDICANS.&mdash;D. N. M. Q. EIUS</span>.</p>

<p>Remains of Roman and medieval buildings and a fountain have
been uncovered in the course of excavating, also some architectural
fragments. The whole length of the Via Sacra has been now
uncovered as far as the steps leading up to S. Bonaventura.</p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF JULIUS CÆSAR.</h4>

<p>The recent excavations along the line of the Via Sacra brought to
light some unimportant remains of shops and houses facing towards
the street. These buildings are of the time of Constantine, and
agree in their construction with his Basilica on the opposite side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the street. This part of Rome was destroyed by fire in the reign of
Commodus, and again under Maxentius (Dion Cassius, Herodian,
Galen, Capitolinus). In this rebuilding they did not clear away
the remains of the older houses, but built on and over them&mdash;a not
unusual custom in Rome. Let us carefully examine the older remains.
Our attention is first attracted by different fragments of beautiful
mosaic pavements of the best period of the art, and evidently the
flooring of no mean house. The first piece that we come across is
composed of a pattern made up of several cubes in different colours;
in the rebuilding this was hid by a pavement of herring-bone brickwork.
Beyond is a beautiful black and white octangular and diamond
mosaic pavement, which also did duty to the rebuilt house. In a
small room adjoining we notice a travertine base of a column, which
stands near a piece of black mosaic pavement, in which are inserted
small squares of white marble; in another chamber close by is a
white mosaic with a black border, and near this another, of white
and black sexangular and diamond shape. Near the cube mosaic are
two more bases of columns of travertine, and a travertine well head:
travertine stone, from Tivoli, was not used in Rome as a building
material till about 50 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> Amongst the constructions of the older
period we notice six distinct pieces of walls composed of tufa blocks,
perhaps old material re-used, some blocks of peperino, and a small
piece of <i>opus reticulatum</i>. Tufa was used during the kingly period,
peperino during the republic, and <i>opus reticulatum</i>&mdash;net-work wedges
of tufa&mdash;by the late republic and early empire. Amidst the later
construction, which is of brickwork, we notice terra-cotta hot-air
pipes, and one piece of a lead pipe, and remains of flights of stairs
leading to upper floors. The brick stamps found were of the second,
third, and fourth centuries. Amongst these remains was found a small
altar. On the scroll at the top is a Roman eagle, and beneath,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
LARIBUS AUG. SACRUM.</p>
</div>

<p>From the line of the bases of the columns we see that the front of
the older house sloped back diagonally from the Via Sacra, the point
farthest from the Forum being nearest to the Via Sacra; whilst the
more recent construction was on a line parallel with, and abutting on
to, the Sacred Way.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-101" id="i-101"></a>
<img src="images/i-101.jpg" width="600" height="381" alt="" />
<br />
<a href="images/i-101l.jpg">View larger image.</a>
</div>

<p>This early house, appearing beneath the building of later date,
is in all probability the house in which Julius Cæsar lived. The construction
agrees with that of earlier and contemporary date. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
the first house on the Via Sacra, and the site coincides with the
notices which we have of Cæsar's house:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He first inhabited a small house in the Suburra; but after his
advancement to the pontificate, he occupied a palace belonging to the
state in the Via Sacra. Many writers say that he liked his residence
to be elegant ... and that he carried about in his expeditions tesselated
and marble slabs for the floor of his tent" (Suetonius, "Cæsar,"
xlvi.).</p>

<p>"As a mark of distinction he was allowed to have a pediment on his
house" (Florus, iv. 3).</p>

<p>"Julius Cæsar once shaded the whole Forum and Via Sacra from
his house, as far as the Clivus Capitolinus" (Pliny, xix. 6).</p>

<p>"The night before his murder, as he was in bed with his wife,
the doors and windows of the room flew open at once.... Calpurnia
dreamed that the pediment was fallen, which, as Livy tells us (in the
lost books), the senate had ordered to be erected upon Cæsar's house
by way of ornament and distinction; and that it was the fall of it
which she lamented and wept for" (Plutarch, in "Cæsar").</p>

<p>"He lay for some little time after he expired, until three of his
slaves laid the body on a litter and carried it home, with one arm
hanging down over the side" (Suetonius, "Cæsar," lxxxii.).</p>

<p>The house of Cæsar was under the Palatine, on which, above
Cæsar's, stood the house of Cicero. "He (Vettius) did not name me,
but mentioned that a certain speaker, of consular rank (Cicero), and
neighbour to the consul (Cæsar), had suggested to him that some
Ahala Servilius, or Brutus, must be found" (Cicero, "Ad Att." ii.
24).</p>

<p>In Cæsar's fourth consulship, the year before he was killed, for
some reason or other the defence of King Deiotarus by Cicero was
heard by Cæsar in his own house. Cicero says to Cæsar: "I am
affected also by the unusual circumstance of the trial in this place,
because I am pleading so important a cause&mdash;one the fellow of which
has never been brought under discussion&mdash;within the walls of a
private house. I am pleading it out of the hearing of any court or
body of auditors, which are a great support and encouragement to
an orator. I rest on nothing but your eyes, your person, your countenance.
I behold you alone; the whole of my speech is necessarily
confined to you alone.... But since the walls of a house narrow all
these topics, and since the pleading of the cause is greatly crippled
by the place, it behoves you, O Cæsar," &amp;c. ("Pro Deiot." ii.).</p>

<p>It was in the year of his prætorship (62 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>) that the scandal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Clodius being found in the house whilst they were about to celebrate
the rites of the Bona Dea happened. "When the anniversary of the
festival comes, the consul or prætor (for it is at the house of one of
them that it is kept) goes out, and not a male is left in it" (Plutarch,
"Cæsar"). The trial that such a scene gave rise to caused Cæsar's
celebrated words on being asked why he had divorced his wife:
"Because I would have the chastity of my wife clear even of suspicion"
(Plutarch, "Cæsar").</p>

<p>Plutarch speaks of it as "a great house." Ovid says the house of
Numa, the Regia, was "small," showing that the house of Cæsar and
the Regia were two distinct edifices.</p>

<p>This old house of which we have been speaking fronted towards
the Temple of Vesta, whilst the portico and shops, built at a late
period over its ruins, ran parallel with the Via Sacra. The house
side of the atrium is plainly marked by the fragments of columns,
composed of travertine coated with stucco, and frescoed. There is
the base of an isolated column near what must have been the middle
of the house side; and to its right there is a half column of the same
workmanship, and between these two bases runs a travertine gutter
which drained the atrium. Amidst the shops built over the atrium
are remains of beautiful black and white mosaic pavement, the
fragments of the borders showing that they once belonged to the
older edifice. On the right of the atrium, towards the Via Sacra,
was an area-vestibulum, giving access to the house from the Via
Sacra, and, like it, paved with polygonal blocks of silex.</p>

<p>There was another entrance to the house at the point where it
nearly touched, at its north-eastern corner, the Via Sacra. The bases
of two columns mark the ingress into a small vestibule which has
a mosaic pavement, on the right of which was the entrance to the
house, the threshold of travertine stone being <i>in situ</i>. There are the
two holes at the ends where the doors turned on their pivots, and
the bolt-hole in the middle.</p>

<h4>THE PORTICUS MARGARITARIA.</h4>

<p>After the fire, the site of Cæsar's house was occupied by shops and
dwellings, along the front of which was an arcade. As these shops
were mostly kept by pearl-dealers, the arcade was known as the
Porticus Margaritaria. It is mentioned in the "Curiosum" and the
"Notitia" of the fourth century as in the eighth region, Forum
Romanum Magnum.</p>

<p>In the recent excavations along the line of the Via Sacra, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
remains of an arcade 201 feet long by 24 feet wide, and consisting of
two rows of piers, have been found running parallel with the street,
and having shops on either side. This no doubt is the Porticum Margaritarium
of the catalogues. Beneath the arcade and the shops are
the remains of Cæsar's house. Judging from the monumental stones,
the pearl trade was an extensive one in Rome; and from the same
authority we learn that the shops were on the Sacra Via. This is
mentioned on the tomb of Ateilius Evhodus at the sixth mile on the
Via Appia.</p>

<h4>THE SACRA CLIVUS.</h4>

<p>Horace was wont to come down the Sacred Way ("S." i. 9), and
talks of Britons descending it in chains ("Ep." vii.). Now we are free
to ascend it. Where the Sacred Way ascends the Velia ridge it will
be noticed that the road is extraordinarily wide (45 feet). This was
no doubt made after the great fire under Commodus, for four feet
below the pavement was found the original and narrower street, and
beneath that the drain in the reticulated work of the republic.</p>

<p>The right-hand side of the ascent was bordered with honorary
monuments and inscriptions to Trajan, Hadrian, Titus, Septimius
Severus, Caracalla, and Constantine; but the most interesting, perhaps,
was the monument with Greek inscription of Gordianus,
erected to him by the citizens of Tarsus, St. Paul's city, and interesting
as showing that the close friendship between Rome and Tarsus
continued to this late period. Four columns of Porta Santa marble
stood on a podium, 7 feet by 4 feet, and supported a canopy, under
which was the emperor's statue. On the cornice was the inscription,
ΤΑΡϹΕωΝ , filled in with bronze.</p>

<h4>THE VICUS SANDALIARIUS.</h4>

<p>This was the street mentioned by Dionysius as leading into the
Carinæ.</p>

<p>In the "Curiosum" and "Notitia" is mentioned the Apollinem
Sandaliarium. This was a statue of Apollo, which gave name to a
street of the fourth region. Suetonius ("Aug." lvii.) says: "With
which donations Augustus purchased some costly images of the gods,
which he erected in several of the streets of the city, as that of
Apollo Sandaliarius." It is mentioned by Aulus Gellius (xviii. 4):
"In Sandaliario forte apud librarios fuimus." Also by Galen ("De
Libris suis," iv. 361).</p>

<p>The marble plan of Rome shows this street by the letters <span class="smcap">DLARIVS</span>.</p>

<p>This was the street, recently excavated, between the Temple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the Penates and the Basilica Constantine, and which led into the
Suburra.</p>

<p>At the entrance from the Via Sacra there still exists a brick
pedestal on which the statue may have stood. For engraving of this,
see Gruter, cvi. 7, and <span class="smcap">D</span>cxxi. 3.</p>

<p>In this street the remains of the Temple of Venus and Rome can
be distinctly seen. A short distance up it is tunnelled over to allow
the Basilica of Constantine to square; but the tunnel is closed about
half way through. From the level of the street the western tribunal
of the Basilica has been built up. The tunnel, called Arco d'Ladroni,
and the street itself, have been used as a burial-place by the monks
of the church; and there is a ninth century fresco of the dead body
of the Saviour over a shrine on the left.</p>

<p><i>Beyond is the</i></p>

<h4>BASILICA OF CONSTANTINE,</h4>

<p>the colossal arches of which have served as models to architects for
building all the larger churches in Rome. This splendid ruin usually
bears the name of the Temple of Peace, erected by Vespasian in this
neighbourhood and partly on this site, and which was destroyed by
fire as early as the time of Commodus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 191. Herodianus, who
saw the fire, says: "By the slight earthquake and the thunderbolt
which followed it, the whole of the sacred enclosure was consumed."
Claudius Galenus, the celebrated physician, says that the whole
edifice was consumed, as also most of his writings, which were in his
shop in the Via Sacra.</p>

<p>This is one of the most imposing ruins in Rome; the three noble
arches which formed the northern side being almost perfect, rising to
the height of 95 feet, and having a span of 80 feet. The southern
side was similar; whilst a noble vaulted roof, supported from the side
piers and arches, covered the centre. Thus, entering from the Vicus
Eros, on the east, the spectator saw a magnificent hall 333 feet long
by 84 feet wide, with aisles 60 feet in width. To the central hall the
tribunal at the west end was added in the rebuilding of Constantine,
when he made the main entry from the Sacra Via, the ruins of
which exist in the porphyry columns. By this entry the nave is 227
feet long, the tribunal being 24 feet deep, and the aisles 80 feet
wide.</p>

<p>Nibby has the merit of having been the first to prove that these
ruins are the last remains of the Basilica erected by Maxentius, and
completed and partially rebuilt by Constantine the Great. In 1828
a medal of Maxentius was found amongst the ruins of a piece of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
vault which fell down. The principal entrance was originally intended
to have been on the side facing the Colosseum, towards a
street that ran out from the left of the Via Sacra, which, turning to
the right, reached the Colosseum.</p>

<p>At a later period it may have been found more suitable to add a
splendid portal on the side facing the Via Sacra; opposite to which,
in the central side arch, a tribune was erected. So whichever way
you enter it, it is a nave with two aisles. Of the vast vaulted
arches spanning the middle space, only the supports from which the
arches sprang still exist. These, however, suffice to indicate what
they must have been. The Basilica contained many works of art,
and the roof was supported by eight columns. The Via Sacra here
passed along the front of the present Church of S. Francis of the
Romans, and the Arch of Titus, to the Palatine.</p>

<p><i>By applying at No. 61 Via del Colosseo, at the back of the Basilica,
permission will be given to ascend to the top, from which a magnificent
view is obtained.</i></p>

<p><i>On our right is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. FRANCISCA ROMANA.</h4>

<p>Built in the ninth century, and called S. Maria Nuova. The mosaic
on the apse dates from 862. There is a monument to Gregory XI.,
and a relief representing the return of the Papal court to Rome from
Avignon. In the transept are the two stones marked with depressions,
said to have been where Peter knelt when he prayed that
Simon Magus might fall. (See picture in S. Peter's, <a href="#Page_115">page 115</a>.) The
church contains a beautiful marble <i>ciborium</i>, and monuments to
Cardinal Vulcani, 1322, and General Rido, 1475.</p>

<p>The foundations of most magnificent buildings of the imperial
times lie buried in the gardens. The paintings on the walls are in
themselves sufficient to give us an idea of the splendour of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
internal decorations of the Roman palaces. The streets, temples,
palaces, &amp;c., are full of interest. Some beautiful views may be
had from various parts of the gardens, from the height near the
entrance, as well as looking over the site of the <span class="smcap">Circus Maximus</span>,
which occupied the valley between the Palatine and Aventine
Hills.</p>

<p><i>In our description of the Palatine we have classed the remains in
chronological order. In the accompanying plan they are numbered in
the order in which they are best visited. The numbers correspond with
those placed by the title of the different ruins in the Guide; so that
the visitor can follow the numbers consecutively in his ramble, and
turn to the corresponding number for the description. We only treat
of the actual remains.</i></p>

<h5>THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PALATINE.</h5>

<p>In studying the Palatine Hill, the topography presents the first
difficulty. It must be borne in mind that the form of the hill has
undergone many important changes since the days of Romulus, and,
as seen by us, is very different from what it was when Romulus built
his city. Now it presents a lozenge-shaped form; then it was oblong
and smaller. Our theory is, that if a line be drawn from about the
Arch of Titus across the hill, that part to the right or west was the
extent of the hill in the time of Romulus; and that to the left or
east, formerly "the pastures round the old town" (Varro), now presenting
the form of a hill, was no hill then. From a careful survey
of the part to the left of our line, we find it to be artificially formed
of imperial ruins upon the top of ruins, rubbish, and accumulation of
soil, and not of rock or solid earth. This new light does away with
innumerable difficulties in studying the form of Roma Quadrata, and
presents to us instead a very simple story.</p>

<p>If the hill had been of the same form then as now, Romulus would
have occupied the whole of it: this he certainly did not do, as his walls
are to the right of our line; and it is not likely that he would have
left part of the hill outside his boundary to command his city or to
be occupied by foes.</p>

<p>Our view agrees with classic authority. Tacitus (xii. 24) describing
the pom&oelig;rium or boundary of Roma Quadrata, which went
round the base of the hill on the level below, thus showing its
shape, says: "The first outline began at the Ox-Market, where still
is to be seen the brazen statue of a bull, that animal being commonly
employed at the plough. From that place a furrow was carried on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of sufficient dimensions to include the great Altar of Hercules. By
boundary stones, fixed at proper distances, the circuit was continued
along the foot of Mount Palatine to the Altar of Consus, extending
thence to the Old Curiæ; next, to the Chapel of the Lares." These
buildings were built after Roma Quadrata, with the exception of the
Altar of Hercules, and are mentioned by Tacitus to mark the line;
they existed when he wrote. Ovid ("Fasti," iv. 825) says: "Pressing
the tail of the plough, he traces out the walls with a furrow; a
white cow with a snow-white bull bears the yoke." Dionysius
(i. 88) says: "Romulus called the people to a place appointed, and
described a quadrangular figure about the hill, tracing with a plough,
drawn by a bull and a cow yoked together, one <i>continued</i> furrow."
Taking these authors for our guides, we can easily trace the line of
the pom&oelig;rium. Commencing at the Forum Boarium, which site is
well known, it went down to the Altar of Hercules, which must
have also been in the Forum Boarium, "in the spot where a part of
the city has its name derived from an ox" (Ovid, "Fasti," i. 581).
Taking in this altar, it passed under the Palatine's southern side to
the Ara Consi, which Tertullian ("De Spec." v.) tells us was buried
in the circus at the first meta. It here turned to the east, passing
along the valley which then existed, along our imaginary line; for it
is ridiculous to suppose that it would have passed right across the
Palatine had the hill been then what it is now. From the Altar of
Consus it extended past the Old Curiæ, which we think may be
seen in the tufa walls under the south end of the Palace of Domitian
(19), then to the Chapel of the Lares, which stands at the head of
the Sacra Via below the Palace of Domitian (17).</p>

<p>"Ædem Larum in Summa Sacra Via" ("Mon. Ancyr."). "Ancus
Martius (habitavit) in Summa Sacra Via, ubi ædes Larum est"
(Solinus, i. 24). "Romulus built a temple to Jupiter, near the gate
called Mugonia, which leads to the Palatine Hill from the Sacra
Via" (Dionysius, ii. 30). The Sacred Way did not pass through the
Arch of Titus, as is generally supposed, but passing by it led up to
the Palatine&mdash;this can be seen by examining the stones&mdash;and was
then called Clivus Palatinus. A large piece of the pavement still exists
on the Palatine, leading up to the Ædem Larum, and which road is
miscalled Nova Via. The road leading from the Arch of Titus to
that of Constantine was called the Clivus Triumphalis.</p>

<p>Hence the furrow must have passed under the north side of the
Palatine, and down the west side to where it began; for Tacitus's
account says, "Hence to the Forum which was added by Tatius." This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
furrow marked the bounds of the city, within which were the walls,
the city itself occupying the hill above.</p>

<p>The remains of the walls of Roma Quadrata existing are sufficient
to show us their exact line, for we have remains on four different
sides, and, curious enough, at three of the angles. On the west and
east sides it appears to have been built up to support the scarped
cliff and above it; but on the south it ran along the edge on the top
of the cliff&mdash;the valley below, beyond the pom&oelig;rium, being then the
Murzian Lake. Along the southern cliff it was not a solid wall, but
had embrasures, through which a <i>balista</i> or <i>catapult</i> might be fired
upon an enemy below&mdash;the remains of which are still existing. These
are the oldest Roman arches, being older than the Cloaca of Tarquin
or the arches of Ancus Martius.</p>

<p>"But Romulus had formed the <i>idea</i> of a city rather than a <i>real</i>
city; for inhabitants were wanting" (Florus, i. 1).</p>

<p>The principal roadway upon the Palatine was the Nova Via, a
new way, evidently made after the Via Sacra, and simply called
Nova Via without any distinguishing name being given to it. It
commenced at the Porta Mugonia on the east, inside Roma Quadrata,
and was here called Summa Nova Via. "Tarquinius Priscus
ad Mugoniam Portam supra Summam Novam Viam" [habitabat]
(Solinus, i. 24). From this point it went along the north and
down the west side past the gate&mdash;there being steps down from the
gate to the road. The descent off the hill was called the Hill of
Victory. "Sed Porta Romana instituta est a Romulo infimo Clivo
Victoriæ" (Festus). "Quæ habet gradus in Nova Via" (Varro).
Passing by the Porta Romana it turned to the left, or west, under
the Palatine to the Velabrum, where it ended. This part was called
Infima Nova Via. "Aius Loquens in Infima Nova Via" (Varro,
"Ap. Gell." xvi. 17). This altar still exists at the south-west corner
under the Palatine. "Hoc Sacrificium [to Larentia] fit in Velabro,
qua in novam Viam exitur" (Varro, "Ling. Lat." vi.).</p>

<h4>ROMA QUADRATA.</h4>

<p class="center">5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 19, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.</p>

<p>Romulus, the son of Rhea Silvia and Mars, founded Rome on the
Palatine Hill, above the Tiber, 753 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, on the site of the Arcadian
city of Evander, near the Lupercal, where the wolf had given him
suckle. The city was built after the Etruscan rites, and surrounded
by a massive wall, in a quadrangular form, whence it was called
Roma Quadrata. See "Walls of Rome," <a href="#Page_XVII">page xvii</a>
.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<h5>THE THREE GATES OF ROMA QUADRATA.</h5>

<p>Pliny (iii. 9) informs us that the city was entered by three
gates.</p>

<h5>PORTA MUGONIA (14),</h5>

<p>situated on the east of the hill, the site of which has been identified
by Varro ("L. L." 164):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Moreover, I observe that the gates within the walls are thus
named; that at the Palatine 'Mucionis' (from 'mugitus,' lowing),
because through it they used to drive out the cattle into the pastures
around the old town."</p>

<h5>PORTA ROMANA (40).</h5>

<p>At the middle of the western side, at the commencement of the
ascent on the Via Nova, called the Clivus Victoriæ in commemoration
of the victory of Romulus over Acron. The remains were discovered
March 1886. Varro says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The other, called Romulana, was so called from Rome, the same
which has steps into the Nova Via at the shrine of Volupiæ."</p>

<p>Festus, speaking of the same gate, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But the Porta Romana was set up by Romulus above the foot of
the Hill of Victory, and this place is formed of tiers of steps disposed in
a square. It is called Romana by the Sabines in particular, because
it is the nearest entrance to Rome from the side of the Sabines."</p>

<h5>PORTA CARMENTA (8).</h5>

<p>Authorities on the subject say that the name and position of the
third gate are lost.</p>

<p>Now we contend that the mass of ruins called the Scali Caci are
the remains of the third gate, and that that gate was the Porta Carmenta,
as distinctly stated by Virgil in his description of the meeting
of Æneas and Evander, "without the gates." "Thus, walking on,
he spoke, and showed the gate, <i>since</i> called Carmental by the Roman
state; then stopping, through the narrow gate they pressed" (Virgil,
"Æn.," viii.). The position corresponds with his description, and is
just the spot where a gate would be required. The remains consist
of two different early periods&mdash;immense blocks of soft tufa of the
Arcadian period, and blocks of hard brown tufa of the time of
Romulus, corresponding with the material of which his wall is
built.</p>

<p>The Porta Carmenta was to the south, and is thus mentioned by
Propertius (iv. 1):&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"Where rose that house of Remus upon tiers of steps, a single
hearth was once the brothers' modest reign."</p>

<p>We suppose he uses the name of Remus here instead of Romulus
on account of the rhythm.</p>

<p>Solinus gives this description of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It [Roma Quadrata] begins at the wood which is in the area of
Apollo, and ends at the top of the stairs of Caius, where was [once]
the cottage of Faustulus."</p>

<p>Plutarch says ("Romulus," xx.):&mdash;</p>

<p>"Romulus dwelt close by the steps, as they call them, of the fair
shore, near the descent from the Mount Palatine to the Circus
Maximus. There, they say, grew the holy blackthorn tree, of which
they report that Romulus once, to try his strength, threw a dart
from Mount Aventine, which struck so deep that no one could pluck
it up, and grew into a trunk of considerable size, which posterity
preserved and worshipped as one of the most sacred things, and therefore
walled it about.</p>

<p>"But, they say, when Caius Cæsar was repairing the steps about
it, some of the labourers digging too close, the root corrupted, and
the tree quite withered."</p>

<p>Now, in this passage, we think we have an explanation of why it
is called the Stairs of Caius, <i>not</i> Cacus. This name does not refer to
Cacus, the shepherd robber, who had his cave on the Aventine, but,
as we learn from the above passage from Plutarch, to Caius the
emperor, who was nicknamed Caligula from his having worn
the sandals so-called of the Roman troops&mdash;he having been brought
up in the camp on the banks of the Rhine, Caius being his proper
name. He, as we have seen, repaired these steps, and so they were
called after him; but that was not their previous name. The question
arises, What was that name? Why, none other than the Porta
Carmenta, the missing third gate of Roma Quadrata, "the gate <i>since</i>
called Carmental by the Roman state."</p>

<p>It was up this gateway that the Romans brought the Sabine
women when they ran off with them in the Circus Maximus.
Valerius Antias says they were five hundred and forty-seven in
number; Plutarch says there were six hundred and eighty-three,
and that the event took place on the 18th of August.</p>

<p>But before this the gate had another name, the original name in the
Arcadian period. We know from Virgil and Diodorus Siculus that it
existed before the time of Romulus, and was incorporated by him
into his city. Let us see what that name was.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>"Hercules, after he had gone through Liguria and Tuscany, encamped
on the banks of the Tiber, where Rome now stands, built
many ages after by Romulus, the son of Mars. The natural inhabitants
at that time inhabited a little town upon a hill, now called
Mount Palatine. Here Potitius and Pinarius, the most eminent
persons of quality among them, entertained Hercules. There are
now at Rome ancient monuments of these men; for the most noble
family, called the Pinarii, remains still among the Romans, and is
accounted the most ancient at this day. And there are Potitius's
stone stairs to go down from Mount Palatine (called after his name),
adjoining to that which was anciently his house" (Diodorus Siculus,
iv. 1). Thus we see that the spot was originally called the Stairs of
Potitius.</p>

<p>Virgil ("Æn.," viii.) informs us that Potitius, the Arcadian high
priest, instituted the worship of Hercules; and that the priests were
selected from the Pinarian house.</p>

<p>"When the new walls were built by Servius Tullius, one of his
gates was named Carmentalis after the above tradition; the original
Porta Carmenta having become obsolete."</p>

<p>The valley between the Palatine and Aventine, the site of the
Circus Maximus, was formerly the Murzian Lake or bay, formed by
an arm of the Tiber, and these stairs led down to the fair shore
(Pulcrum Littus, Καλὴ Ἀκτή )&mdash;that is, to the shore of the lake,
where Æneas landed&mdash;and this had nothing to do with the banks of
the Tiber, which would hardly be called a fair shore by Plutarch.
Virgil calls it "the strand."</p>

<p><i>The above name was also given to one of the temples.</i></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF ROMA QUADRATA (6).</h4>

<p>"A certain hallowed place on the Palatine before the Altar of
Apollo Rhamnusii (5), which every city built with Etruscan rites contained,
and in which were placed those things considered of good
omen in founding a city" (Festus). This hallowed place, as well as
the city, was called by Romulus Roma Quadrata.</p>

<h4>ALTAR OF APOLLO RHAMNUSII (5),</h4>

<p>called the Altar of Apollo of the Blackthorn. Erected in commemoration
of the blackthorn tree that sprang from the staff of
Romulus. The large tufa blocks of the altar, and in front of it the
Temple of Roma Quadrata, still remain, and by their side the Porta
Carmenta.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CURIÆ VETERES (19).</h4>

<p>Romulus divided the people into three tribes, and each tribe into
ten curiæ (Dionysius, ii. 8), thus making thirty curiæ in all. Each
curia had its own priests and separate dining-room and chapel,
which were also called curiæ (<i>Ibid.</i>, ii. 23). The only one of these
which we have mentioned as existing at a late period is the one connected
with the Palatine: as we have seen, it is one of the objects
Tacitus gives us for the line of the plough. Now, on the Palatine, on
that line, we have a ruin below the present surface agreeing with the
time of Romulus in its construction, to which no name has been given
by the topographers, but which we consider as the Curiæ Veteres
mentioned by Tacitus. It now supports the Auditorium of Domitian.</p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF ROMULUS</h4>

<p>"was where the Roma Quadrata ended, at the corner as you turn from
the Palatine Hill to the Circus" (Dionysius). It was upon that part
of the hill called Germalus from the twins being left there when the
flood went down. This would be the shelf at the south-west corner
of the Palatine.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER STATOR (13),</h4>

<p>vowed by Romulus when his army was fleeing before the Sabines, if
Jupiter would stay their flight; hence the name. "Romulus built a
temple to Jupiter near the Porta Mugonia" (Dionysius, ii. 30). It
was restored by Scipio, <span class="s08">A.U.C.</span> 459 (Livy, x. 37). It was in this
temple that Cicero made his first oration against Catiline (Plutarch).
Cicero says that here the goods of Pompey were offered for sale.</p>

<h4>UNDER THE REPUBLIC.</h4>

<p>It was not till the glories of the republic outshone the memory of
the kings that the Palatine became the favourite residence of the
wealthy. We have record of the houses inhabited by Vaccus, Catulus,
Crassus, the Gracchi, Ceneus, Cicero, Scaurus, Mark Antony,
and other notorious republicans. Some slight remains of republican
walls can be seen at various points.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF CYBELE (4).</h4>

<p>Dedicated by M. J. Brutus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 191, under the name of Mater
Idæa, Mother of the Gods (Livy, xxxvi. 36). "Cybele was not worshipped
in Rome till <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 550, when the goddess, a stone, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
brought from Pessinus, a city of Phrygia, by Scipio Nasica" (Strabo).
The vessel containing it having grounded at the mouth of the Tiber,
remained immovable till Claudia Quinta, to prove her chastity, after
calling upon the goddess, drew the ship with slight effort to Rome
(Ovid, "Fasti," vi. 300). This event is commemorated upon an altar in
the Capitoline Museum. The form of the temple remains, and part of
the seated statue of the goddess, a beautiful fragment, corresponding
with her figure as represented on coins. The remains are of <i>opus incertum</i>.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF VICTORY (9).</h4>

<p>The remains of this are just inside the Porta Carmenta. It was
founded originally by the Greek settlers, and restored under the republic;
the construction agrees with this supposition, for here we have
the two different stones used in these periods, soft tufa and peperino.</p>

<p>"Upon the top of the hill they set apart a piece of ground, which
they dedicated to Victory, and instituted annual sacrifices to be
offered up to her also, which the Romans perform even in my time"
(Dionysius, i. 32), A.U.C. 458. "They carried the statue of Cybele
into the Temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill" (Livy, xxix. 14).</p>

<p><i>Near this ruin, on the other side of the road, are the remains of</i></p>

<h4>THE SHRINE OF MAIDEN VICTORY (9<span class="smcap">A</span>).</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 560, "Marcus Portius Cato dedicated a chapel to Maiden
Victory, near the Temple of Victory, two years after he had vowed
it" (Livy, xxxv. 9).</p>

<h4>ALTAR TO AIUS LOQUENS (35).</h4>

<p>Still standing; was erected 124 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, on the site where Camillus had
erected the original, in the undetermined state, to the unknown voice
that warned Marcus Cedicius of the approaching Gauls, 391 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>"In the Via Nova, where now is the shrine, above the Temple of
Vesta" (Livy, v. 23). "A voice was heard in the Grove of Vesta, which
skirts the Nova Via at the foot of the Palatine" (Cicero, "Div." i. 45).</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF JUPITER VICTOR (21).</h4>

<p>Founded during the second Samnite war by Fabius Maximus
(Livy, x. 29)&mdash;326&ndash;304 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>&mdash;overlooking the Circus Maximus. The
remains consist of tufa substructions, steps leading up to the temple,
and some peperino fragments.</p>

<p>The circular altar on the steps, found close by, bears an inscription
to Calvinus, consul <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 53&ndash;40.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF GERMANICUS (10),</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>See plan, <a href="#Page_81">page 81</a>
</i>)</p>

<p>called erroneously by various authorities the House of Claudius Nero,
of Livia, of Augustus. It was incorporated into the Imperial Palace
by Tiberius, though for very many years it preserved its distinctive
title. Josephus tells us that "Caligula was killed in a private narrow
passage within the palace as he was going to the bath, having turned
from the direct road along which his servants had gone. The passages
also were narrow wherein the work was done, and crowded
with Caius's attendants, whence it was that they went by other ways,
and came to the house of Germanicus, which house adjoined to the
palace." A crypto-portico still connects this house with the Palace of
Caligula, another going off at right angles to the House of Augustus.</p>

<p>We have here a good specimen of a Roman house. In the vestibulum
are remains of the mosaic floor and frescoed walls. The
atrium still shows the pattern of its pavement. The tricliniarium
is ornamented with frescoes of arabesque work, animals and fountains,
also with mosaic pavement. The tablinium, in three parallel
halls, painted with beautiful arabesque groups; wreaths of flowers
and fruit; a group of Galatea and Polyhymnia; another of Mercury,
Io, and Argus; a view of a Roman house; a lady at her toilet, &amp;c.
Behind these is the peristylium, out of which open the bedrooms,
bath, kitchen, &amp;c. In the centre tablinium are some leaden pipes,
found in the excavations, stamped with the names of Julia, Domitian,
and Niger,&mdash;the daughter of Augustus, the emperor, and the insurgent.</p>

<h4>THE PALACES OF THE CÆSARS</h4>

<p>gradually incorporated the whole of the Palatine buildings; and
when we speak of the Palace of the Cæesars, it is not meant that it
was one, but different palaces, built by different emperors, called after
them, and connected with those previously erected by crypto-porticoes.</p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF AUGUSTUS (18).</h4>

<p>"He resided in a small house formerly belonging to Hortensius.
This was destroyed by fire, and rebuilt by contributions of the public"
(Suetonius). The palace was destroyed by fire, under Titus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 72;
the ruins were filled in by Domitian in the second year of his reign,
and upon the top he built his celebrated palace. The remains of the
Palace of Augustus&mdash;not now accessible, being under the convent&mdash;were
explored and partly excavated some years ago.</p>

<p>From the <span class="smcap">Palace of Domitian</span> (17) we can descend into some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
small chambers, the vault of one being adorned with a fresco representing
Victory.</p>

<h4>THE GELOTIANA (32),</h4>

<p>mentioned by Suetonius as the place from which Caligula viewed the
games in the Circus Maximus, is supposed to have been a house occupied
by the guard and servants of the palace. Its ruin consists of chambers at
the base of the hill, under the convent. It was here that the skit of the
Crucifixion, now in the Museum of the Collegio Romano, was found.
(See <a href="#Page_160">page 160</a>
.) The walls are still covered with names, &amp;c., scratched by
the soldiers.</p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF TIBERIUS (3).</h4>

<p>We learn from Suetonius and Tacitus that it was situated on the
western side of the Palatine, overlooking and communicating with
the Velabrum. The remains consist of vast halls and substructions,
and a row of arches supposed to have been the guard's quarters.
This palace has yet to be excavated.</p>

<h4>THE PALACE OF CALIGULA AND HADRIAN (2).</h4>

<p>"Having continued part of the Palatine as far as the Forum, he
converted the Temple of Castor and Pollux into the vestibule of his
house." "He built a bridge over the temple of the deified Augustus,
by which he joined the Palatine to the Capitol" (Suetonius). He connected
his palace with that of Tiberius by means of porticoes. The
remains consist of a suite of rooms, portions built over the Clivus
Victoriæ, chambers with fresco and stucco decorations, and mosaic
pavements, also a portion of the beautiful marble balustrade of the
solarium. Suetonius tells us that this palace was destroyed by fire;
in fact, most of the remains show the construction of Hadrian, who
must have rebuilt it and used it as his palace.</p>

<p>The remains of this palace have been recently uncovered at the
northern side of the Palatine. It appears that the palace was built
in a series of terraces against the Palatine Hill, the construction
showing work of Caligula, Trajan, and Septimius Severus. There
are some chambers which were warmed with hot air in terra-cotta
pipes, and containing fragments of statuary on the lowest level excavated.
Then, on the terrace above, there is an arcade paved with
blocks of silex, and on one side shops. A flight of travertine steps
conducts to some small chambers above, with mosaic pavements and
frescoes, which were built by Hadrian against a wall of Caligula
having frescoes on yellow and white grounds. The side walls and
vaults are decorated with frescoes of the time of Hadrian.

<h4>THE PALACE OF DOMITIAN (17).</h4>

<p>He used the remains of Augustus's palace, destroyed by fire in the
second year of the reign of Titus, filling in the chambers of the earlier
buildings with earth, so that they formed a solid foundation. "He
embellished the portico, in which he took his airing, with polished
stone, so that he might observe if any one approached him" (Suetonius).
The remains consist of the tablinium, or summer-parlour; the
lararium, or chapel of the household gods; the bed-chamber where he
was assassinated; the tricliniarium, or dining-room; the peristylium,
or open court; nymphæum, or aquarium; the vometarium; auditorium;
and the crypto-porticoes connecting it with the other palaces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BASILICA (16).</h4>

<p>When the Palace of Augustus and the other edifices were burned
down, Domitian filled them in with earth, and on the top of the platform
built his palace. But some of the destroyed edifices were consecrated:
as he could not do away with them, he rebuilt them upon
the higher level, over their
old sites. The basilica and
chapel of the household gods
were both treated in this
way. As this was the only
basilica on the Palatine, we
may presume that it was the
court of appeal unto Cæsar
himself. If so, on this site
S. Paul appeared before Nero;
but not in this identical
building, which was erected
by Domitian, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 81&ndash;96, after
Paul's death, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 64.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i-122" id="i-122"></a>
<img src="images/i-122.jpg" width="240" height="242" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLAN OF THE BASILICA ON THE PALATINE.</p>
</div>

<p>The Basilica was the hall
of justice, coming from a
Greek word signifying "the
regal hall." It consisted of a tribunal, nave, and aisles. The
form was oblong; the middle was an open space, called <i>testudo</i>,
and which we now call the nave. On each side of this were
rows of pillars, which formed what we should call the aisles, and
which the ancients called <i>porticus</i>. The end of the testudo was
curved, and was called the <i>tribunal</i>, from causes being heard there.
A rail separating the tribunal from the body of the hall was called <i>cancelli</i>,
because it was of open work. Not far from the entrance was a
round stone in the pavement, on which the prisoner stood to be tried.
Between the judge's seat on the tribunal and the rails stood the altar
of Apollo. These halls were likewise used as places of exchange by
business men. Being the largest halls the Romans had, the form of
them was copied by the early Christians for their churches. The
tribunal was called the apse; in some churches it is still called the
tribunal. The judge's seat gave place to the bishop's throne; the
altar of Apollo to the communion table; the cancelli to the chancel;
and the fountain in the court in front to the holy-water basins;
and so the name was handed down and given to Christian churches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
though there is not a single church in Rome that was once a
pagan basilica, or hall of justice. Many of the so-called basilicas
are not true basilicas, for they have introduced the transept to
give them the form of a cross.</p>

<h4>THE STADIUM (26).</h4>

<p>On the east side of the Palatine, built by Domitian, and only partly
excavated. Used for races both for men and women. "Young
girls ran races in the Stadium, at which Domitian presided in his
sandals, dressed in a purple robe made after the Grecian fashion, and
wearing upon his head a golden crown bearing the effigies of Jupiter,
Juno, and Minerva; with the flamen of Jupiter and the college of
priests sitting at his side in the same dress, excepting only that their
crowns had also his own image on them" (Suetonius).</p>

<p>The work of excavating the Stadium is not yet completed. It
appears that the portico surrounding it originally consisted of
cipollino columns, with composite capitals. This was rebuilt in the
third century in two tiers, supported with half-columns of brick,
coated with slabs of marble, having Ionic bases and Doric capitals.
A brick stamp informs us that the Imperial tribune was built in the
third consulship of Ursus Servianus, under Hadrian, 134. At the
edge of the foot-course, below the portico, was a marble channel to
carry off the rain-water. Traces of the spina still remain. The
Stadium seems to have been altered into a hippodrome in the time
of Diocletian by building elliptical walls upon its surface. The
following stamp was found on some of the bricks,&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.D. 500 OFFS R.
F. MARCI HIPPODROME THEODORIC REGNANTE DN THEODERICO FELIX
ROMA</span>,&mdash;evidently some of the repairs ordered by the great king
during his six months' visit to Rome.</p>

<h4>THE EXEDRA, OR ODEUM (27).</h4>

<p>On the right of the Stadium, for musical performances, with three
chambers underneath decorated with fresco work.</p>

<h4>THE NYMPHÆUM OF MARCUS AURELIUS (30).</h4>

<p>We claim the honour of having discovered the use of these imposing
ruins, whose summit is climbed by many visitors to enjoy the
fine view over the Campagna. It was built by the best of the
Roman emperors as a large reservoir for the supply of water to the
Palatine Hill, acting as the Trevi Fountain does at present. We
have traced the specus of the aqueduct to it; and the top is covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
with <i>opus signinum</i>, the peculiar cement used by the Romans whenever
they conducted water.</p>

<p>The brickwork shows signs of careful construction; the courses of
cement carefully laid between the bricks being of the same thickness
as the bricks themselves, seven of which measure a foot. The
Nymphæum probably took its name from the female statues which
decorated it, handing down the custom of the ancient Romans in
peopling the springs with nymphs.</p>

<p>It is thus mentioned by Marcellinus (xv. vii. 3):&mdash;"The Emperor
Marcus built the Nymphæum, an edifice of great magnificence, near
the well-known Septemzodium," which was built by Septimius Severus
at the corner of the Palatine, where slight traces of it remain;
it having been destroyed by Pope Sixtus V.</p>

<p>The spot now forms a pleasant terrace, from which a splendid
prospect of the southern part of ancient Rome, the Campagna, and
the distant Alban Hills may be enjoyed. In fact, a vast study is
spread, like a map, before the visitor.</p>

<h4>THE PALACE OF COMMODUS (25, 29)</h4>

<p>stood on the south-east side of the hill. He constructed a passage
from the Palatine to the arena of the Colosseum. He was strangled
in his chamber; and his successor, Pertinax, was stabbed in the
same palace. This was destroyed by fire, and on the top of the ruins
was erected the Palace of Septimius Severus, Caracalla, and Alexander
Severus. The remains consist of numerous chambers, corridors,
and vaults, still retaining some of their mosaic pavements and stucco
roofs, with walls built into them in a very confused manner, showing
different alterations. The palace is to be cleared out.</p>

<h4>THE PALACE OF THE CÆSARS.</h4>

<p>After the death of Alexander Severus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 235, we have little or
no history of buildings upon the Palatine, and there are no remains
the construction of which shows a later date. Indeed the emperors
reigned but a short time down to Diocletian, except Gallienus, who,
we know, had a palace and gardens on the Esquiline. Fifty years
after Alexander Severus died a great blow was struck at the grandeur
of Rome; for the colleagues in empire, Diocletian and Maximian,
made new capitals at Milan and Nicomedia, and thus divided the
seat of power and empire. In <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 302, eighteen years after his
declaration, Diocletian came to Rome for the first time, to celebrate
his triumph, making a short stay of two months. The year 312
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
witnessed a great change. On October 28 the great Constantine, the
first Christian emperor, and a Briton, made his entry into the imperial
city, which for years had ceased to give rulers to the empire, and
was now to be the seat of government no longer. Constantine did
not make a long stay in the city; and, after he had secured his power,
removed in 330 the capital of the empire to Byzantium, which was
named Constantinople, to decorate which Rome was stripped of
statues, marbles, and works of art. In 356 Constantius visited
Rome, which had been abandoned by her rulers and denied the
splendours of the imperial court. "After his entry he retired into
the imperial palace, where he enjoyed the luxury he had wished for."
"He quitted Rome on the thirtieth day after his entry (29th May)"
(Marcellinus). The same historian informs us that, "on the night of
the 18th of March 362, the Temple of Apollo, on the Palatine, was
burned down." Theodosius, in 394, entered Rome in triumph.
Honorius, his son, in 403 celebrated the grandest triumph since that
of Diocletian, one hundred years before. Indeed, during this long
period but four emperors had paid flying visits only to their ancient
capital, and the Palace of the Cæsars was falling into decay, as
Claudian, the last of the Roman poets, sings. Honorius for a short
time revived the glories and memories of the past; the curule chairs
once more surrounded the rostra, and their emperor's voice was once
more heard by the <i>plebs</i>, whilst they gazed with awe at the lictors
with their gilt fasces. After Honorius's departure, Alaric, and the
barbarians that were with him, in 410, "took Rome itself, which
they pillaged, burning the greatest part of the magnificent structures
and other admirable works of art it contained" (Socrates,
"E. H." v. 10). In 417 Honorius again entered Rome in triumph,
and endeavoured to restore the city, and invited fugitives from all
parts to people it. This benefactor of the city was buried near the
supposed remains of S. Peter in the Vatican basilica. In 425
Valentinian III., whilst still a boy, received the imperial purple
in the ancient Palace of the Cæsars, at the hands of an ambassador of
Theodosius; and, although Ravenna was the seat of his government,
he frequently visited Rome and inhabited the imperial palace.
During one of these visits, in 454, Aetius, the general, fell in the
imperial palace, stabbed by the hand of the licentious emperor, who
drew his sword for the first time to kill the general who had saved
his empire. In the following year, March 27, he was himself assassinated
in the Campus Martius during a review; and Petronius Maximus
was declared emperor, but was in his turn soon after murdered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
The third day thereafter, Genseric and his Vandals entered Rome,
and plundered it of everything they could carry off, from the seven-branched
candlestick to the common utensils of Cæsar's Palace, which
they completely stripped. Avitus, a Gaul, the successor of Petronius,
visited Rome for a short time, and was murdered on his return to
Auvergne. After the throne had been vacant for ten months, Majorianus
was made emperor by Ricimer, 457. He published an edict from
Ravenna against destroying the ancient monuments of Rome and
using the materials for building. Severus Libius was his successor,
and he was poisoned within the walls of the Palatine, August 465.
Anthemius entered Rome in a triumphal procession in April 467,
and revived the Lupercalia games; he was put to death in the
palace by Ricimer, who captured Rome, July 11, 472. From 472 to
476 there were four emperors, the last of whom, Romulus Augustus,
abdicated in presence of the senate, who proclaimed the extinction
of the Western Empire.</p>

</div>

<p>In <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 500 King Theodoric paid a visit of six months to Rome.
After addressing the people from the Rostra ad Palmam, which stands
at the head of the Forum, he took up his residence at the Palace of
the Cæsars, and appointed officers to take care of the ancient monuments.
After his death, Athalaric and his mother governed till the
former's death in 534. Theodatus, his successor, was murdered on
the Flaminian Way, as he was retreating before Belisarius, the
general of the Eastern emperor Justinian, who fixed his quarters at
the Pincian Palace. In 549 Totila captured the city, and resided in
the Palace of the Cæsars, exhibiting games in the Circus Maximus
for the last time. During the winter of 552&ndash;553 Narses, the Eastern
general, took Rome, and resided there, Rome being again united to
the Eastern Empire, governed by an exarch, who generally resided
at Ravenna. The history of the Palatine is a blank till the time of
Heraclius I. Though not present himself, a coronation ceremony
was held with great pomp in the Palace of the Cæsars, 610. A great
event for Rome took place in 663. Then, for the last time, she
received within her walls her emperor, Constans II., who contemplated
again making her the capital of the empire. He was received
by Pope Vitalianus at the Porta Appia with a procession of priests
with tapers, banners, and crosses,&mdash;a curious contrast with former
usages. Constans was the last emperor who resided in the Palace of
the Cæsars, which was even then in a dilapidated condition; and his
time seems to have been occupied with church ceremonies. His visit
lasted twelve days, when he carried off what plunder he could, besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the gilt bronze tiles of the roof of the Pantheon. A blank again
occurs till Justinian II., in 709, created the first Duke of Rome,
who was afterwards elected by Pope and people, and resided in the
Palace of the Cæsars. For many years the power of the Church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Rome had been increasing, and in 772 Pope Adrian I. threw off the
nominal sovereignty of the Eastern Empire, and, calling upon Charlemagne
to free him from the Lombard kings, he entered Rome on
Saturday, April 2, Easter eve. Charlemagne confirmed Pepin's gifts
to the Holy See. He again visited it, and on Christmas day <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 800
Pope Leo III. crowned him emperor in S. Peter's, with the title
of Emperor of the Romans. From thence commenced the Holy
Roman Empire.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Leaving the Palatine, we turn to the right, and by the newly-excavated

<h4>THE ARCH OF TITUS.</h4>

<p>On the ridge of the Velia hill, which forms a continuation of the
Palatine, and separates the hollow of the Forum from that of the
Colosseum, a triumphal arch was erected (though not till after his
death and deification) to Titus, the conqueror of Jerusalem. The
reliefs, still preserved within the arch, are among the most remarkable
of the kind existing in Rome as to the position they occupy in
the history of art and of the world. We find here not only the
emperor standing in the triumphal chariot in which he advanced to
the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, but also the table of the shewbread,
and the seven-branched candlestick, borne in this triumphal
procession as the most precious spoils of the Jewish temple.</p>

<p>"There was a golden table, which weighed many talents; also a
golden candlestick, which was constructed upon a different principle
from anything in use amongst us now. In the middle was the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
stem, which rose out of the base; from this proceeded smaller branches,
very much resembling the form of a trident; and on the top of them
was a lamp, worked in brass. There were seven such in all, emblematic
of the seven days of the Jewish week. The Law of the Jews
was the last of those spoils in the procession" (Josephus, "Wars of
the Jews," viii. v. 5). "The legs of the table were perfectly finished
in the lower half, like those the Dorians put upon their couches, but
the upper half of them was worked square" (Josephus, "Antiquities
of the Jews," iii. vi. 6).</p>

<p>Two censers were placed upon the table; in front of the table are
two trumpets crossed. (See Exodus xxv. 26).</p>

<p>These spoils were deposited by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace.
After the sack of Rome, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 455, the Vandal king Genseric carried
them to Carthage. Belisarius recovered them, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 535, and took
them to Constantinople; and they were transferred from there to
the Christian Church in Jerusalem (Procopius, "De Bell. Vand.,"
i. 5 and ii. 4).</p>

<p>Evagrius (iv. 17) relates that when Khosroes, king of Persia, took
Jerusalem in 614, they passed into his hands; and all trace of them
has been lost since then. It is altogether erroneous to suppose they
were thrown into the Tiber.</p>

<p><i>On the opposite side</i> is the Emperor Titus in a chariot drawn by
four horses, preceded by Romans wearing laurel wreaths and carrying
the fasces. Behind the chariot, Victory is in the act of placing
a crown on the emperor's head. The vault is ornamented with
square coffers and roses, and in the centre the apotheosis of Titus, in
square relief.</p>

<p>At this point the Via Sacra was sometimes called the Clivus Palatinus,
as it led up to the Palatine, <i>on the right</i>.</p>

<p>"Cl&oelig;lia had her statue in the Via Sacra, as you go up to the
Palatine" (Plutarch, in "Publicola").</p>

<p><i>Passing through the Arch of Titus,</i></p>

<p><i>On our right</i> are some remains of the Frangipani fortress, a tower
of the middle ages; a piece of the second wall of Rome; some substructions
and walls, as it were supporting the Palatine Hill; and
remains of the Baths and</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF THE SUN,</h4>

<p>"built by Elagabalus, on the slopes of the Palatine, for the worship
of the Syro-Ph&oelig;nician sun-god, which was represented by a black
conical stone, set with gems. Elagabalus broke into the Temple of

Vesta, intending to remove the Palladium to his Temple of the Sun,
but the virgins, by a pious fraud, defeated his object, on discovering
which he broke into their sanctuary, and carried off one of the virgins
to add to his list of wives" (Lampridius).</p>

FORUM OF CUPID.<br />
<a href="images/i-130l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The temple was built for the worship of the Sun. Around it
was the Lavacrum, or gratuitous baths, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 218&ndash;222. The temple
was converted in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 800 into the Church of S. Maria, by Pope
Leo III. The remains of the altar can be seen at the east end; at
the west end is the baptistery, in the form of a Greek cross, with an
apse at the top containing the raised platform with the depressed
basin of the font in which the person about to be baptized stood,
whilst the minister occupied the platform above it and poured the
water over his head.</p>

<p><i>On our left is</i></p>

<h4>THE FORUM OF CUPID AND ITS BASILICÆ,</h4>

<p>miscalled the Temple of Venus and Rome. The platform upon which
it stands is partly the Velia ridge and partly artificial.</p>

<p>When a building was inaugurated after consecration it was called
a <i>templum</i>. A <i>delubrum</i> was an isolated building, surrounded with
an area, dedicated to religious purposes. This&mdash;because it was double,
having two aspects, two distinct apses or tribunals&mdash;we call, in the
plural number, <i>delubra</i>, or the double basilica.</p>

<p>The remains consist of two large tribunals, back to back, with a
portion of the lateral walls and vaults. The wall in the monastery
gardens is apsidal, the other is rectangular.</p>

<p>The name of this building is entirely lost. All we know about it
is, that it is of the time of Maxentius and Constantine, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 306&ndash;337,
the construction showing it to be of that time; besides, Nibby found
in the walls bricks stamped with the name of Maxentius.</p>

<p>Nearly all late authorities have called this ruin the Temple of
Venus and Rome. Now, it could not possibly be that temple, for
we are told distinctly, as we have related, by Apollodorus, that the
Temple of Rome was <span class="smcap">NOT</span> built on a platform. Again, the Temple of
Rome was built by Hadrian, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 118&ndash;138, and these remains are of
the time of Maxentius and Constantine, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 306&ndash;337; besides, Roman
temples had no tribunals or apses.</p>

<p>These basilicas were surrounded by a colonnade of gray granite,
numerous fragments of which still lie about, and there was probably
originally a forum or market-place for the sale of fruit and toys.</p>

<p>Varro (L. L. 532, R. R. i. 2), Ovid (A. A. ii. 265), Propertius (iii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
xvii. 11), Terence, Eunuchus, contemporary writers, all speak of a
macellum and forum of Cupid upon the Via Sacra.</p>

<p>Festus, who lived in the fourth century, speaks of them under the
same name; so we may conclude that the ruins before us are the
basilicas of the Forum of Cupid, restored by Maxentius, and dedicated
by Constantine.</p>

<p>The front of this platform, towards the Colosseum, was discovered
in 1828 to have been used during the middle ages as a cemetery,
several coffins of terra cotta being exhumed.</p>

<p>At the corners are the remains of steps which led from below up
to the delubra. Near the left-hand steps, in descending, are the
remains of the</p>

<h4>PEDESTAL OF NERO'S COLOSSUS,</h4>

<p>which, as we have seen, first stood in the vestibule of his house; then
where the atrium was; thence it was removed by Hadrian with
twenty-four elephants to this spot, as is shown on a coin of Alexander
Severus. It was 120 feet high. Vespasian radiated the head
to make it represent the sun; Commodus took off Nero's head, and
replaced it with his own. The popular quotation from Bede refers
to this Colossus, not to the Colosseum.</p>

<p><i>In a line with Nero's Pedestal is the</i></p>

<h4>META SUDANS,</h4>

<p>the remains of a fountain, erected by Titus, and repaired by Domitian
and Gordianus, which stood in the centre of a large circular basin.
Popular tradition narrates that the gladiators used to wash here after
combat: it is certainly possible, but not very probable, that they would
come outside to wash at an open fountain. The epithet Meta Sudans,
or "sweating-goal," is supposed to be taken from the perpetual issue
of foaming water, or because it contributed to satisfy the thirst of the
audience at the Colosseum; or <i>meta</i>, because it was built in the form
of a goal, and <i>sudans</i>, because the water trickled out.</p>

<p><i>To the right is</i></p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE,</h4>

<p>dedicated by the senate and people of Rome to commemorate the
victories of the first Christian emperor, to do which they took reliefs
from the Arch of Trajan, and built them into an attic which they
erected upon the top of the Arch of Isis, re-dedicating the conglomeration
as the Triumphal Arch of Constantine. The reliefs which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
refer to Trajan can be easily distinguished from those of Constantine
(which are very bad) owing to their superior style and the subjects
represented.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-133" id="i-133"></a>
<img src="images/i-133.jpg" width="600" height="371" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ARCH OF CONSTANTINE.<br />
<a href="images/i-133l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The designs commence, <i>on the left side</i>, with the triumphal entrance
of Trajan by the Porta Capena, after the first Dacian war; then,
secondly, commemorate his services in carrying the Appian Way
through the Pontine Marshes; thirdly, founding an asylum for
orphan children; fourthly, his relations with Parthamasiris, king of
Armenia. <i>On the opposite side</i>, dedication of the aqueduct built by
Trajan (<i>seen on the left</i>); secondly, audience with the Dacian king
Decebalus, whose hired assassins are brought before him; thirdly,
with a representation of the emperor haranguing his soldiers; and,
fourthly, the emperor offering the <i>suovetaurilia</i> sacrifice of a boar,
ram, and bull.</p>

<p>Corresponding with these reliefs, two medallions, representing the
private life of the emperor in simple and graceful compositions, are
introduced over each of the side arches. The first represents his
starting for the chase; the second, a sacrifice to Silvanus, the patron
of silvan sports; the third displays the emperor on horseback at a
bear-hunt; and the fourth a thank-offering to the goddess of hunting.
On the side facing the Colosseum, a bear-hunt, a sacrifice to Apollo,
a group contemplating a dead lion, and lastly a consultation of an
oracle. Most of these refer to Trajan; we think some refer to Hadrian,
because on one of them Antinoüs is represented. On the inside of
the arch is a battle-piece, assigned to Constantine by the inscriptions,
"To the founder of peace," "To the deliverer of the city." They
are older than his time. Over the side arches are some narrow reliefs
referring to Constantine, one of which is peculiarly interesting, as it
represents that emperor addressing the people from the Rostra ad
Palmam, with some of the principal monuments in the Forum in the
background.</p>

<h4>THE COLOSSEUM.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"A noble wreck in ruinous perfection."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Byron.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>The vast amphitheatre erected in the centre of ancient Rome by
Vespasian was known to the ancient Romans as the Flavian Amphitheatre.
It was begun by the Flavian emperors <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 72, and dedicated
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 80. It is 157 feet high, and is 1900 feet in circumference, and was
built by the captive Jews after the fall of Jerusalem. Originally the
upper story was of wood, but this was burned down, and it was
rebuilt with travertine stone like the rest of the edifice. Martial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
tells us that its site was formerly occupied by the artificial lakes of
Nero; and Marcellinus (xvi. x. 14) says, "The vast masses of the
amphitheatre so solidly erected of Tiburtine stone, to the top of
which human vision can scarcely reach." All the brickwork we now
see are repairs at various dates after the dedication; but there is
enough travertine left at different points to show that it was originally
built of this stone, as recorded by the historian. For nearly five
hundred years it was the popular resort of the Roman populace and
their betters. There were eighty arches of entrance, and it held one
hundred thousand people, and could be emptied in ten minutes; such
were the order kept and regulations observed that there was no confusion.
It was devoted to the exhibition of wild beasts, their fighting
together, gladiators fighting together, or with beasts, and naval
fights. On these latter displays the stage or arena was moved, water
let in, and naval fights represented in real earnest.</p>

<p>Suetonius ("Vespasian," vii.), says, "He began an amphitheatre in
the middle of the city, upon finding that Augustus had projected
such a work." <i>Ibid.</i> ("Titus," vi.): "He entertained the people with
most magnificent spectacles, and in one day brought into the amphitheatre
five thousand wild beasts of all kinds."</p>

<p>The last display was given by Theodoric in 523; and in 555
the lower part was destroyed by a flood from the Tiber, when
the whole of Rome was under water for seven days. From then
we must date the ruin of the Flavian Amphitheatre&mdash;the Romans
themselves hastening on the work, using the material for building
purposes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Which on its public shows unpeopled Rome,</p>
<p>And held uncrowded nations in its womb."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Juvenal.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>It is held by the Roman Church, on the authority of an inscription
found in the Catacombs, that the architect of the Colosseum was
one Gaudentius; but that inscription only says that he was employed
there. We believe the architect to have been Aterius, whose
monument is now in the Lateran, and upon which several buildings
are represented of which he was no doubt the architect, also the
machine used to raise the stones into their places. He flourished
at the end of the first century, and, no doubt, these buildings shown
in relief upon his tomb were erected by him, the dates agreeing; for
if not, why should they be there represented?</p>

<p>First, we have an arch which says on it, "Arcus ad Isis." Now if
we compare this with the Arch of Constantine, we find it is the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
without the attic. Then we have the amphitheatre without the
upper story; then an arch (query, Arch of Domitian?). Then
another arch with the words, "Arcus in Sacra Via Summa:" compare
this with the Arch of Titus, and, minus the restorations, it will
be found to be the same. Then there is a temple agreeing with the
descriptions of that of Jupiter Stator upon the Palatine. All these
buildings were erected or rebuilt about this time, and from being
recorded on this monument of the Aterii, tend to show that Aterius
was the architect of them.</p>

<p>When perfect, the Colosseum consisted of four stories&mdash;the
lowest, of the Doric order, 30 feet high; the second, Ionic, 38 feet
high; the third, Corinthian, about the same height; and the fourth,
also Corinthian, 44 feet high. The holes in the cornice with the
corbels below them were to receive the masts that supported the
<i>velaria</i> on the outside.</p>

<p>The numerous holes in the stone were made in the middle ages for
the purpose of extracting the iron cramps that kept the stones from
shifting. The long diameter is 658 feet, the shorter 558 feet; the
arena is 298 feet by 177 in its widest part.</p>

<p>The last performance was a bull-fight, held at the expense of the
Roman nobles, in the year 1332. Many martyrs are said to have
perished in the Colosseum during the persecutions of the early
Christians, and among others S. Ignatius, who was brought from
Antioch to be devoured by wild beasts. Benedict XIV. consecrated
the building to the Christian martyrs, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1750.</p>

<p>In excavating the Basilica of S. Clement, the Rev. Father Mullooly
found (1870) the remains of S. Ignatius, and had them carried
with great ceremony over the scene on the anniversary of his
martyrdom.</p>

<p>At the present day there remains sufficient to indicate the construction
of the building, though but a small portion of the immense
outer shell, which originally both adorned and formed an impenetrable
girdle round the whole, has been preserved. In the interior,
a great deal of rebuilding has been necessary for its preservation.</p>

<p>Vast as the building is, its construction is easily understood; a
simple segment of the whole serving to show how all the others succeed
one another like the cells of a bee-hive.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-137" id="i-137"></a>

</div>

<p>The upper part was originally of wood only, and was burned, having
been set on fire by lightning. The three lower stories only are of
the time of the Flavian emperors; the upper story was rebuilt
and added in the third century, and only finished in the time of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Gordiani, as is shown by the coins representing it. The imperial
entrance was from the Esquiline side, between the arches Nos. 38, 39,
which is without number. Commodus constructed an underground
passage from the arena to the Palatine, which has not yet been discovered,
his so-called passage (<i>on the right in entering</i>) being that by
which the dead bodies were carried from the arena. Dion Cassius
says: "Upon the last day of the sports his helmet was taken off
and fell through the door where the dead used to be carried
out."</p>

<p>The area, basement, or ground-floor, was flooded for the naval
fights. Surrounding this were the dens, in front of which was a
channel for fresh water for supplying the animals with drink&mdash;a
spring still supplies it; about ten feet above was the movable stage,
sprinkled with sand for the combats, and hence called the arena. A
few feet above the arena was the podium, or seat of the emperor,
vestal virgins, &amp;c., protected from the arena by iron bars. Behind
the podium was a double portico, which ran round the whole building.
Fragments of the marble chimeras, with long wings, that
ornamented the seats of the podium have been found.</p>

<p>The three successive tiers were called <i>cavea</i>. Above these was a
tier for the people; above this one for the "gods;" thus making six
in all. The amphitheatre seated eighty-seven thousand people, and
there was standing room for thirteen thousand more.</p>

<p>The walls standing upon the area, composed of tufa, travertine,
and brick, old material re-used, were built at a period long after
the building was dedicated, when the naval fights being abandoned
there was no longer any occasion for a movable stage or arena as
before. They contained the machinery for the stage above, and for
the lifts or <i>pegmata</i> to send men or beasts from the area to the arena.
Probably these are the walls thus alluded to by Dion Cassius: "He
[Commodus] divided the theatre into four parts by two partitions
that cut through diametrically, and by right angles, to the end that
from the galleries that were round about he might with greater ease
single out the beasts he aimed at."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-139" id="i-139"></a>
<img src="images/i-139.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PLAN OF THE EXCAVATIONS BELOW THE ARENA OF THE COLOSSEUM.<br />
<a href="images/i-139l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>"The emperor having employed himself in shooting from above
... descended afterwards to the bottom of the theatre, and there
slew some other private beasts, whereof some made toward him,
others were brought to him, and others were shut up in dens.
Returning after dinner, he used the exercises of a gladiator, with a
shield in his right hand, and in his left a wooden sword. After him
fought those whom he had chosen in the morning at the bottom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the theatre." Also, in his life of Septimius Severus, he says: "There
was a kind of cloister made in the amphitheatre, in the form of a
ship, to receive them [the wild beasts]. On a sudden there issued
out bears, lions, ostriches, wild asses, and foreign bulls."</p>

<p>The walls before us are of very bad construction, evidently repairs
of a late date: they are the work of either Lampridius, prefect of
Rome under Valentinian III., 425&ndash;455, who repaired the steps and
renewed the arena; or of Basilius, who restored the podium and
arena after their destruction by an earthquake in 486&mdash;this we learn
from two inscriptions standing at the entrance. Half way, on each
side, two large passages have been discovered choked up with mud:
they were the aqueducts to bring the water for the <i>naumachiæ</i> from
the reservoirs upon the Esquiline and Cælian Hills respectively; from
the small openings in the blind arches the water also poured out over
the top of the dens, thus forming cascades all round. At the end
opposite the present entrance a long passage has been opened, above
the level of the area floor; below this passage is the great drain, with
the remains of the iron grating<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to prevent large objects going down:
this and the passage were closed by flood-gates on naval representations,
which can be clearly seen in the construction. On the right
and left of this passage, connected with it, but at a lower level, two
dens have been cleared out, 27 yards long by 5 wide, containing six
holes in the floor, in the centre of square blocks of stone, and these
holes are faced with bronze, evidently the sockets into which metal
posts were fixed to which the beasts were chained. On the fragments
depicting scenes from the arena, the animals are shown with
a long piece of rope or chain dangling from their necks, which seems
to bear out our idea that they were attached to posts fixed in these
sockets, and that as they were wanted the chain or rope was cut, and
they were free to rush upon the arena.</p>

<p>The corbels round the front of the line of arches under the podium
are in pairs, and between them the masts were inserted to support
the awning on the inside, as the holes and corbels supported the
masts on the outside; for we find on examination that those inside
are exactly in a line with those outside at the top of the building.
These corbels are 29 inches deep, and from them to the level of the
area is 10 feet, and to the present surface 11 feet; between each
pair of corbels are chases 19½ inches wide, ending on a block of travertine
for the masts to rest on, the chases coming down 1½ yards
below the corbels, which are 15 feet apart. They probably helped to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
support the arena, and show what the height of this wooden arena
must have been, and that from its vast size it must have had a framework
and supports: the numerous holes on the area, in travertine,
were for the heels of the supports; one of these, a square one, has
remains of the decayed timber in it.</p>

<p>In the central passage, resting on the area and extending as far as
the excavations, is an ancient wooden framework in a decomposed
state. Various suggestions have been made as to its use,&mdash;we suppose
it to be the framework and joists of the flooring covering the central
passage; others, a sort of tramway for running the cages along,&mdash;but
till the whole space has been cleared out it is impossible to arrive at
a correct estimate of its use.</p>

<p>Honorius, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 404, having abolished the gladiatorial combats,
probably the last display of wild beasts was that given by King
Theodoric at the beginning of the sixth century.</p>

<p>The soil cleared out in the passage, dens, galleries, and area was
found to be composed of mud deposited during a flood or floods
by the Tiber, the composition of which may still be seen in parts
of the long passage not yet cleared. The most remarkable of
these floods, which lasted some days and did immense damage to
the city, were those of <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 555, 590, 725, 778, 1476, 1530, 1557,
and 1598.</p>

<p>We may presume, from the nature of the soil, that at some early
date, probably <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 555, one of those terrible floods reached the
Colosseum, and on the waters retiring a great deposit of mud was
left, covering the old area floor and filling up the various passages
and galleries, and that the authorities, instead of clearing out this
deposit, added to it to make a solid floor, and used the arena above;
for after that date we have no record of its being used, with the
exception of the bull-fight.</p>

<p><i>By applying to the custodian, the visitor can ascend to the top</i>, where
a most magnificent view is enjoyed, the only way to get a good idea
of its size and oval shape, and where the construction of the upper
galleries can be studied. It will be seen that the arches forming the
tiers of seats have at some date been filled in with brickwork, of the
time of Alexander Severus and the Gordiani. The water-courses for
keeping the building cool in hot weather can also be traced. The
highest wall of all, the inside brick casing of which is partly gone,
is built of fragments evidently not originally intended for the purpose
for which they are used, corresponding to a great extent with
the construction of the walls upon the area.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>The Colosseum was for a long time used as a quarry, from which
several of the palaces in Rome were built.</p>

<p>Should the visitor be fortunate enough to see the ruin under
moonlight, or when it is illuminated with Bengal lights, he will
see it in its grandeur, for "it will not bear the brightness of the
day."</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Over the Tiber.</i>)</p>

<h4>THE ROUTE.</h4>

<p><i>From the Piazza del Popolo the Via Ripetta leads towards S.
Peter's, turning off to the right, past the bridge, by the Via Monte
Brianzo.</i></p>

<p><i>From the Piazza di Spagna we take the Via Condotti to the Via
Monte Brianzo and Tor di Nona.</i></p>

<p>At the right-hand end of the latter street is the Apollo Theatre,
built on the site of the Tor di Nona prison, where Beatrice Cenci
was confined. Passing into the Piazza Ponte S. Angelo, on our
left, is the Italian Free Church of Gavazzi, and in the Palazzo
Altoviti, in front, lived Visconti.</p>

<p><i>We turn to the right over</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BRIDGE OF S. ANGELO,</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Ponte S. Angelo</i>,)</p>

<p>which is decorated with ten angels standing on the parapet, bearing
the instruments of our Lord's passion; and SS. Peter and Paul,
an addition made in 1668 by Clement IX. It is the finest bridge
in Rome, and was built by Hadrian.</p>

<h4>TOMB OF HADRIAN, NOW THE CASTLE OF
S. ANGELO.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Castel S. Angelo. Permissions required: see <a href="#Page_353">page 353</a>.</i>)</p>

<p>It was covered with white Paros marble, and decorated with statues
of the gods and heroes, the works of Praxiteles and Lysippus, which
were hurled upon the heads of the Goths. Erected by Hadrian, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 130.
The porphyry sarcophagus, which is supposed to have contained his
remains, is now used as the font in the chapel on the left in S. Peter's.</p>

<p>Procopius thus describes it: "The tomb of the Emperor Hadrian
is situated outside the Porta Aurelia. It is built of Parian marble,
and the blocks fit close to one another without anything to bind them.
It has four equal sides, about a stone-throw in length; its altitude
rises above the city walls; on the top are statues of the same kind
of marble, admirable figures of men and horses."</p>

<p>Lucius Verus, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Commodus,
were all buried here. It was first turned into a fortress <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 423.
Popes John XXIII. and Urban VIII. built the covered way
connecting it with the Vatican. One of the barrack-rooms contains
frescoes by Pierino del Vaga and Sicciolante, another by
Giulio Romano. A circular room, surrounded with carved wood
cases, once contained the archives of the Vatican. A large iron-bound
chest contained the treasury. Some dark cells built in the
thickness of the walls are shown as the prisons of Beatrice Cenci (?),
Cellini, Cagliostro, and others. Tradition asserts that Gregory the
Great saw S. Michael standing over the fortress sheathing his
sword as a sign that a pestilence was stayed; to commemorate which
the castle is now surmounted by a figure of the archangel in the act
of sheathing his sword. This old castle served for a fortress during
several ages, and its first cannon were cast out of part of the
bronze taken from the roof of the Pantheon.</p>

<p><i>The Borgo Nuovo leads to</i> the Cathedral, passing, <i>on the right</i>, the
Church of S. Maria, built on the site of a pyramid to Honorius,
423 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, which is represented on the doors of S. Peter's.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h4>S. PETER'S.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>S. Pietro.</i>)</p>

<h5>EXTERIOR.</h5>

<p>Before the era of railways, the traveller in approaching Rome,
across the Campagna, was generally electrified by the first glimpse of
S. Peter's dome looming in the distance. Then he had full time, in
advance of entering the gates of the city, to ponder over all the
recollections which the magical word "Roma" might suggest to him.
At present he is rapidly borne into the city, and sometimes before
he is aware of having arrived even in its neighbourhood; yet the
dome is plainly visible from afar by the railway approach of to-day.
Now, as then, the first sight of Rome is always her unequalled
cathedral; now, as then, the latter is the great object which the
tourist eagerly hastens to visit. The present Church of S. Peter is
relatively modern, having been first conceived by Pope Nicholas V.
about the year 1450. It is built upon the site of the religious edifice
erected in the time of Constantine, and consecrated as the "Basilica of
S. Peter." The old basilica stood on part of the Circus of Nero, and
occupies the spot consecrated by the blood of the martyrs slaughtered
by order of that tyrant. Tradition supposes that the basilica held possession
of the body of the apostle after his crucifixion,&mdash;a circumstance
which reflected high credit upon it, and dignified its entrance with the
appellation of the "limina apostolorum" (threshold of the apostles).
After enjoying the veneration and tributes of all Christendom during
eleven centuries, the walls of the old basilica began to give way, and
its approaching ruin becoming visible about the year above stated,
Nicholas V. conceived the project of taking down the old church,
and erecting in its stead a new and more expensive structure. The
project was begun, and resulted, after a long series of experiments
made by various architects, in the splendid fabric which is now
regarded by the world as the chief glory of modern Rome. The
work made slight progress until the epoch of Julius II., who resumed
the great task, and found in Bramante an architect capable of comprehending
and executing his grandest conceptions. The walls of
the ancient basilica were then wholly removed, and on the 18th of
April 1508 the foundation stone of one of the vast pillars supporting
the dome, as we now see it, was laid by Julius with great pomp
and ceremony. From that period the work, though carried on with
ardour and perseverance, continued during one hundred years to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
occupy the attention and absorb much of the incomes of eighteen
pontiffs. The most celebrated architects of the times displayed
their talents in its erection&mdash;namely, Bramante, Raphael, San Gallo,
Michael Angelo, Vignola, Carlo Maderno, and last, though not least,
Bernini, who gave it the finishing touches of ornamentation, and
who built the enclosing colonnade. It is estimated that its cost,
after completion, was no less than £12,000,000 sterling&mdash;a sum
representing a far greater value than it does in our day. Colossal
statues of Peter and Paul, erected by Pius IX., guard the approach
at the foot of the steps on either side.</p>

<p>Eustace says: "Entering the piazza, the visitor views four rows
of lofty pillars, 70 feet high, sweeping off to the right and left in a
bold semicircle. ('A tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time from
the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and
from rain,' Isa. iv. 6.) In the centre of the area formed by this immense
colonnade, an Egyptian obelisk, of one solid piece of granite,
ascends to the height of 130 feet; two perpetual fountains, one on
each side, play in the air, and fall in sheets round the basins of
porphyry that receive them. Raised on three successive flights of
marble steps, extending 379 feet in length, and towering to the
elevation of 148, you see the majestic front of the basilica itself.
This front is supported by a single row of Corinthian pillars and
pilasters, and adorned with an attic, a balustrade, and thirteen colossal
statues. Far behind and above it rises the matchless dome. Two
smaller cupolas, one on each side, add not a little to the majesty of
the principal dome."</p>

<p>Five lofty portals open into the vestibule; it is 468 feet in length,
66 in height, and 50 in breadth, paved with variegated marble,
covered with a gilt vault, adorned with pillars, pilasters, mosaic, and
bas-reliefs, and terminated at both ends by equestrian statues, one
of Constantine, the other of Charlemagne.</p>

<h5>THE OBELISK</h5>

<p>is the only one near its original site, the <i>Spina</i> of Nero's Circus,
which was near the Sacristy, on the left of S. Peter's. An inscription
in the pavement marks the place. Pliny (xxxvi. 14), says: "The
third obelisk at Rome is in the Vatican Circus, which was constructed
by the emperors Caius [Caligula] and Nero; this being the
only one of them all that has been broken in the carriage. Nuncorcus,
the son of Sesoses, made it [<i>the original, this is probably a
copy</i>], and there remains [in Egypt] another by him, 100 cubits in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
height, which, by order of an oracle, he consecrated to the sun, after
having lost his sight and recovered it." Herodotus says: "It was
dedicated by Phero, son of Sesostris, in gratitude for his recovery
from blindness." It has no hieroglyphics, so if this was the original
how could they know who erected it? but it bears this inscription of
Caligula&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Nuncorcus of Pliny is supposed to stand for Menophtheus,
the king Meneph-Pthah.</p>

<p>Pliny (xvi. 76) gives the following particulars of how it was
brought over:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A fir tree of prodigious size was used in the vessel which, by the
command of Caligula, brought the obelisk from Egypt, which stands
in the Vatican Circus, and four blocks of the same sort of stone to
support it. Nothing certainly ever appeared on the sea more
astonishing than this vessel; 120,000 bushels of lentils served for its
ballast; the length of it nearly equalled all the left side of the port of
Ostia&mdash;for it was sent there by the Emperor Claudius. The thickness
of the tree was as much as four men could embrace with their arms."</p>

<p>Suetonius ("Claudius," xx.) says: "He sank the vessel in which
the great obelisk had been brought from Egypt, to secure the foundation
of the mole at Ostia."</p>

<p>Pliny (xvi. 76), says: "As to the one in which, by order of the
Emperor Caius, the other obelisk had been transported to Rome, it
was brought to Ostia, by order of the late Emperor Claudius, and
sunk for the construction of his harbour."</p>

<p>Marcellinus says: "Subsequent ages to Augustus brought also
other obelisks, one of which is in the Vatican."</p>

<h5>VESTIBULE.</h5>

<p>Over the entrance <i>outside</i> is a relief of Christ giving the keys to
Peter; <i>inside</i> the vestibule is Giotto's (1298) celebrated mosaic,
representing our Lord sustaining Peter when he was about to
sink whilst walking on the sea. Opposite are the great bronze
doors, opened only on special occasions, the work of Antonio
Filareto and Simone Donatello in the fifteenth century. The upper
panels represent in relief our Saviour and the Virgin, below whom are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
SS. Peter and Paul; Peter is giving the keys to Pope Eugenius IV.
Beneath are the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul: in the former is represented
the pyramidal tomb which stood in the Borgo Nuovo, and
which was destroyed by Alexander VI. The smaller reliefs represent
scenes from the life of the Emperor Sigismund&mdash;his coronation,
the council of Florence, and his entry into Rome. The framework
represents satyrs, nymphs, fauns, Leda and the Swan, Ganymede,
the Fox and the Stork, with reliefs of fruit and flowers, and medallions
of Roman emperors. The walled-up side door, on the right, is the
Porta Santa, which was formerly opened on Christmas-eve of the
years of jubilee&mdash;every twenty-fifth year.</p>

<p><i>The first</i> inscription relates the gift of olive-yards to provide oil
for the lamps given by Gregory II.</p>

<p><i>The second</i>, the Bull of Boniface VIII., of the indulgence granted
at jubilee.</p>

<p><i>The third</i>, Panegyric of Charlemagne on Pope Adrian I.</p>

<h5>INTERIOR.</h5>

<p>Five portals give access to the edifice, which faces east.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Enter, its grandeur overwhelms thee not."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Byron.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>"The most extensive hall ever constructed by human art expands
in magnificent perspective before you. Advancing up the nave, you
admire the beauty of the variegated marble under your feet, and the
splendour of the golden vault overhead, the lofty Corinthian pilasters
with their bold entablature, the intermediate niches with their
statues, the arcades with the graceful figures that recline on the
curves of their arches. But how great your astonishment when you
reach the foot of the altar, and, standing in the centre of the church,
contemplate the four superb vistas that open around you; and then
raise your eyes to the dome, at the prodigious elevation of 440 feet,
extended like a firmament over your head, and presenting, in glowing
mosaic, the companies of the just and the choirs of celestial spirits....</p>

<p>"Around the dome rise four other cupolas, small, indeed, when
compared with its stupendous magnitude, but of great boldness when
considered separately; six more, three on either side, cover the
different divisions of the aisles; and six more of greater dimensions
canopy as many chapels. All these inferior cupolas are, like the
grand dome itself, lined with mosaics. Many, indeed, of the masterpieces
of painting which formerly graced this edifice have been
removed [to the Church of S. Maria degli Angeli, see <a href="#Page_265">page 265</a>
], and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
replaced by mosaics, which retain all the tints and beauties of the
originals, impressed on a more solid and durable substance. The
aisles and altars are adorned with numberless antique pillars that
border the churches all around, and form a secondary order" (Eustace).</p>

<p>The variegated walls are in many places ornamented with festoons,
wreaths, crosses, and medallions representing the effigies of different
pontiffs. Various monuments rise in different parts of the church,
of exquisite sculpture, and form very conspicuous features in the
ornament of this grand temple.</p>

<p>Below the steps of the altar, and, of course, some distance from it,
at the corners, on four massive pedestals, four twisted pillars, 50 feet
in height, rise and support an entablature, which bears the canopy
itself, topped with a cross. The whole is 95¼ feet from the pavement.
This brazen edifice&mdash;for so it may be called&mdash;was constructed
of bronze stripped from the dome of the Pantheon, and is so disposed
as not to obstruct the view by concealing the chancel and veiling the
chair of S. Peter. This ornament is also of bronze, and consists of
a group of four gigantic figures, representing the four principal
doctors of the Greek and Latin Churches, supporting the chair at an
elevation of 70 feet. Under the high altar of S. Peter's is the tomb
of that apostle, the descent to which is in front, where a large open
space leaves room for a double flight of steps. The rails that surround
this space above are adorned with one hundred and twelve
bronze cornucopiæ, which support as many silver lamps, burning
during the day in honour of the apostle. Upon the pavement of the
small area enclosed by the balustrade is the kneeling statue of Pius
VI., by Canova.</p>

<h5>A PROMENADE IN S. PETER'S.</h5>

<p>On entering, the size of objects may be judged by noticing the
cherubs that support the holy water basins; they present no extraordinary
appearance, but stand by them and their immense size will
be appreciated. The first chapel, on the right, contains Michael
Angelo's Mary with the Dead Christ; hence it is called the Chapel of
La Pietà. It was executed by the great master when only twenty-four,
and bears his name across Mary's girdle. This work of art is
unfortunately very badly placed for proper observation. Opening
out of this chapel are two side chapels, kept closed: in that of the
left are kept the relics belonging to the basilica; and in the right, a
column, ornamented with flutings and reliefs, and said to be the
column against which Jesus leaned when disputing with the
doctors.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the aisle, on the right, is Fabris's statue of Leo XII.;
and opposite, Carlo Fontana's monument to Christina, Queen of
Sweden, who died in Rome in 1689, after her abjuration of Protestantism.
The chapel beyond contains a beautiful mosaic copy of
the Martyrdom of S. Sebastian; the original was by Domenichino.
Next is the monument to Innocent XII., supported by Charity and
Justice, by Filippo Valle; and opposite is one to the Countess
Matilda, by Bernini; the relief is Gregory VII. giving absolution to
Henry IV.</p>

<p>The Chapel of the Sacrament contains, above the altar, a fresco
by Cortona; over the side-altar is a mosaic copy of Caravaggio's
Entombment. The principal altar is formed with a model in lapis
lazuli and gilt bronze of Bramante's chapel; the original is erected
over the spot pointed out as the scene of Peter's martyrdom. Before
the side-altar is the bronze tomb of Sixtus IV., with reliefs by
Antonio del Pollajuolo; near by is interred Julius II., whose monument,
now in S. Pietro in Vincoli, was to have been the grand
masterpiece of Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>Beyond, on the right, is the monument to Gregory XIII., supported
by Religion and Power, with a relief representing the correction
of the calendar, the work of Rusconi. Opposite is Gregory
the Fourteenth's simple marble urn.</p>

<p>The next chapel is named Madonna del Soccorso, containing the
monument to Gregory XVI., erected by the cardinals he had
made. On the left is a mosaic copy of Domenichino's Last Communion
of S. Jerome. In the aisle, proceeding on the right, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the monument to Benedict XIV. (with figures of Science and
Charity), by Pietro Bracci. Opposite is a mosaic copy of S. Basil
Celebrating Mass before the Emperor Valens, after Subleyra's
picture.</p>

<p>In the transept are mosaic copies of S. Wenceslaus, king of
Bohemia, by Caroselli; Martyrdom of SS. Processus and Martinianus,
after Valentin; and that of Erasmus, after Poussin. In the aisle,
leading out, is Canova's celebrated tomb of Clement XIII. It took
eight years to execute. The pope is represented praying: on one side
is the genius of Death with inverted torch (the finest piece of sculpture
in S. Peter's), and on the other Religion with the cross; at the
angles are a wakeful and a sleeping lion. Opposite is a mosaic of S.
Peter Walking on the Sea, after Lanfranco. In the next chapel is
a mosaic of Guido's S. Michael and Guercino's S. Petronilla. On
the left, coming towards the apse, S. Peter Resuscitating Tabitha,
from Costanzi's painting; and opposite is the tomb of Clement X.,
by Ferrata.</p>

<p>In the centre of the apse is S. Peter's chair. January 18th is the
feast of the chair of S. Peter in Rome. Some remarks on the chair
which does duty for S. Peter's may be of interest to our readers.
A photograph of this famous object was taken in 1867, when it was
last exposed to view, and can be had at any of the shops in Rome.
Visitors must be content with looking at the photograph, for the
chair itself is not to be seen. At present it is enclosed in the
bronze covering which is supported by the four colossal figures
of the doctors of the Church&mdash;SS. Gregory, Jerome, Ambrose, and
Augustin.</p>

<p>It is encased in a framework, in which are the rings through which
the poles were inserted in order to carry the person seated. This
casing, consisting of four posts and sides, is made of oak, and is very
much decayed. The straight vertical joints are easily distinguished
where the frame is attached to the chair itself, which is composed of
dark acacia wood. The front panel is ornamented with three rows
of square plates of ivory, six in a row, eighteen in all, upon twelve
of which are engraved the labours of Hercules, and on the other six,
constellations, with thin <i>laminæ</i> of gold let into the engraved lines.
Some of the ivories are put on upside down, and had evidently
nothing to do with the original chair: they are Byzantine in style,
of the eleventh century. The ivory band decorations of the back
and sides evidently belonged to the chair, and correspond with its
architecture and fit into the woodwork. They are sculptured in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
relief, representing combats of men, wild beasts, and centaurs. The
centre point of the horizontal bars has a portrait of Charlemagne
crowned as emperor. In his right hand is a sceptre (broken), and in
his left a globe; two angels on either side offer him crowns and
palms, they having combatants on each side. The chair is 4 feet
8¾ inches high at back, 2 feet 10½ inches wide, 2 feet 2&#8531; inches deep,
and 2 feet 1½ inch high in front. Fancy Peter using such a chair
as this!</p>

<p>It is asserted by the Roman Church that this chair was used by
S. Peter as his episcopal throne during his rule over the Church at
Rome. Even if we grant, for argument's sake, that he was bishop
in Rome, there is no evidence to prove that this was his chair; in
fact, every evidence to the contrary. All the primitive episcopal
chairs are of marble, and as unlike this one in construction as possible;
for it is not an episcopal throne, but a <i>sella gestatoria</i> or
cathedra, similar to the chairs introduced into Rome in the time
of the Emperor Claudius, mentioned by Suetonius ("Nero,"
xxvi.), and Juvenal (i. 64, vi. 90). It is not unlike in shape
the one used to carry the Pope in grand ceremonies in S.
Peter's. Some early authors speak of a <i>sella gestatoria</i> which
was placed in the baptistery of old S. Peter's by Damasus, and
which, formerly on the 22nd of February, was carried hence to
the high altar, where the Pope, with much ceremony, was enthroned
upon it.</p>

<p>The chair which was originally assigned as that of S. Peter was
eventually passed on from one chapel to another, till, it is said, that,
when Rome was sacked by the imperialists in 1527, they stripped it
of its ornaments and covering, for the sake of their value; and that
beneath they found an old carved wooden chair, with the inscription,
"<i>There is only one God, and Mohammed is his prophet</i>"&mdash;which same
formula is engraved upon the back of the marble episcopal chair in
the Church of S. Pietro in Castello at Venice. In 1558, the feast of
the chair of S. Peter was fixed in Rome for the 18th of January, and
in Antioch for February 22nd; and in 1655 Pope Alexander VII.
placed this chair where it now stands. The present chair is medieval,
ninth century, and is unlike early representations in art of the
chair used by the Apostle Paul, which we may look upon as
episcopal.</p>

<p>The ivory diptych of St. Paul (<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 400), the property of Mr.
Carrand of Lyons, engraved by the Arundel Society, represents Paul
seated on a chair, holding in his left hand a roll, the symbol of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
apostleship, whilst the right hand is raised in the act of blessing
Linus, who carries a book in his hand. At the back of the chair is
S. Mark, holding a roll in his left hand. The chair is light, and
not unlike a modern library one in shape. Later art agrees with
the present chair. A fresco at S. Clement's, Rome (1050), represents
Peter installing Clement into the Papal chair&mdash;a chair, so far
as can be seen, not unlike the present one of S. Peter, which was
made after the coronation of Charlemagne as Emperor of the Holy
Roman Empire (<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 800).</p>

<p>Upon our right is the tomb of Urban VIII. His bronze statue is
by Bernini, with Justice and Charity in marble. On our left is
Della Porta's monument to Paul III.; likewise a bronze figure, with
Prudence (the Pope's mother, Giovanna Gaetani) and Justice (his
sister, Giulia Farnese). Justice is a beautiful figure, but the tin
drapery put on to cover its nakedness by Bernini destroys its
beauty. It is necessary to re-paint the tin every now and then.
There is a deal of this mock modesty in S. Peter's.</p>

<p>Turning into the south aisle, on our right, is the tomb of Alexander
VIII. The bronze statue is by Arrigo, and the figures of
Religion and Prudence by Rossi. The relief represents the Pope
canonizing five saints. Opposite is the mosaic of S. Peter at the
Gate of the Temple. It is said that this scene, here represented,
gave to President Lincoln the idea for his proposed motto for the
greenbacks. When the commission applied to him for a motto to
put upon the notes, he said, "I can think of nothing better than
what Peter said to the sick man at the gate of the temple&mdash;'Silver
and gold have I none, but what I have that give I unto
thee.'"</p>

<p>Beyond, upon the right, is a splendid alto-relief by Algardi, representing
Leo threatening Attila with the vengeance of Peter and
Paul if he should attack the holy city of Rome. It is the largest
relief ever executed. A circular marble slab below it marks the
tomb of Leo XII. Upon the right, coming down the aisle, is the
tomb of Alexander VII., by Bernini. Justice, Prudence, Charity,
and Truth surround the kneeling pontiff. A bronze gilt figure of
Death supports the marble canopy. The naked Truth was clothed
in tin by Innocent XI. Opposite is Vanni's oil-painting, the Fall
of Simon Magus. The south transept contains mosaics of S.
Thomas by Camuccini, the Crucifixion by Guido, and S. Francis
by Domenichino. On the left is the chair of the Grand Penitentiary,
where great princes have to make their public confession as pilgrims.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Returning to the aisle, on the right is the tomb of Pius VIII., by
Tenerani. Our Saviour is blessing the Pope; Peter and Paul are on
either side; Justice and Mercy are represented in relief below.
Opposite is a mosaic of Ananias and Sapphira after Roncalli. Beyond
is the Miracle of Gregory the Great, by Sacchi. Facing us is the
tomb of Pius VII., by Thorwaldsen. History and Time support him
on either side, with Power and Wisdom below. On the left, nearly
opposite, is a mosaic copy of Raphael's Transfiguration. Proceeding
down the aisle, on our right, is the tomb of Leo XI., with a relief,
by Algardi, representing the abjuration of Henry IV. of France.
Opposite is the tomb of Innocent XI., with relief of the raising of
the siege of Vienna by John Sobieski, with figures of Religion and
Justice, by Monot.</p>

<p>On our right is the Chapel of the Choir, decorated by Giacomo
della Porta. The mosaic altar-piece of the Conception is after Pietro
Bianchi. Over the door, in the pier on the left of the chapel, is a
niche closed with a wooden sarcophagus; here the body of the Pope
is placed till his tomb is prepared. Opposite is the bronze memorial
to Innocent VIII. by the brothers Pollaiolo. The spear-head held
in the hand of the Pope refers to the spear which pierced our
Saviour's side, it being presented to this Pope by the Emperor
Bajazet II. On our right is a fine mosaic by Romanelli, the
Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple. Beyond, on the left,
is Canova's memorial to the "last of the Stuarts," who died in
Rome, and are buried in the crypt below. It takes the form of an
entrance to a tomb, which is guarded by beautiful genii. Over the
door are the words&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Blessed are the dead that die in the
Lord</span>." Above are medallions of the Chevalier S. George, Prince
Charlie, and the Cardinal York, the whole being surmounted by
the British coat-of-arms, in which is quartered that of France.
This monument was erected by George IV. Opposite, over the
door leading to the dome, is the monument to Maria Clementina,
wife of the Chevalier S. George, whose portrait in mosaic is by
Barigioni. Beyond is the baptistery. The font is of red porphyry,
which was once the top of the tomb of Otho II., and
originally, it is said, of Hadrian. In front is Carlo Maratta's
Baptism of Christ in mosaic; upon the left Peter baptizing the
jailers in the Mamertine prison, a fiction from Passeri; and opposite
is Procaccini's Baptism of the Centurion. This baptistery is
said to be on the site of a temple to Apollo, upon what authority
we cannot say.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>The nave has marked in the centre of its pavement the measurement
of all the principal churches in the world, whereby it can be
seen that S. Peter's is 93 feet longer than S. Paul's, London. The
large porphyry circular slab is that upon which the holy Roman
emperors were crowned, and where the priest who is made judge of
ecclesiastical matters in the Roman Church is ordained. In a niche
in each of the piers supporting the vault are colossal statues, 16 feet
high, of the founders of the various religious orders; and in the piers
of the dome are S. Longinus, the soldier who pierced our Saviour's
side, S. Helena, who found the cross, S. Veronica, who wiped his
face, and S. Andrew. Above are kept the relics of these saints,
which are only shown to those who hold the title of a canon of the
church. On the spandrels of the arches of the dome are four large
mosaics, representing Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, with their
emblems. S. Luke's pen is 7 feet long, and the letters on the frieze
are 6 feet high.</p>

<p>The great piers are 253 feet in circumference; which space is
exactly occupied by the church and house of S. Carlo, in the Via
Quattro Fontane. Near the first pier of the right side is the celebrated
bronze seated statue of S. Peter, with the keys in one hand,
the other raised in the act of blessing, under a canopy erected by Pius
IX., whose portrait in mosaic surmounts it. It is asserted by some
that this was a statue of Jupiter, supremely good and great, that
stood in the Capitoline temple, and that it was altered into S.
Peter; others say they recast Jupiter into the "Jew Peter."</p>

<h5>THE SACRISTY</h5>

<p>is connected with S. Peter's by a long gallery, and is adorned with
pillars, statues, paintings, and mosaics. It is entered by passing
through a door under the monument to Pius VIII., in the left aisle.
There is a very rich collection of church plate and vestments kept in
the <i>guardaroba</i>, which visitors should not fail to see.</p>

<h5>THE CRYPT.</h5>

<p><i>Orders must be obtained of Cardinal Ledockowski, Palazzo Cancelleria.
It must be visited before 11 <span class="s08">A.M.</span></i> The entrance is at the
side of the statue of S. Veronica. It contains the tombs of the
early Popes, and also some old bas-reliefs, and some very ancient
statues of S. Peter. Adrian IV., the only English Pope, is buried
here, and also several distinguished historical characters, including
"the last of the Stuarts."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<h5>THE DOME.</h5>

<p><i>Orders must be obtained of Monsignor Fiorani, in the Sacristy, for
visiting the dome, which is only open without an order on Thursdays,
between 8 and 10 <span class="s08">A.M.</span></i></p>

<p>It is reached by a winding ascent, the entrance being opposite the
Stuart monument. On the platform of the roof the cupolas, domes,
and pinnacles are seen to advantage; and hence, by different staircases
between the walls of the cupola, the ball is reached. During
the ascent, a fine view may be obtained of the lower parts of the
church, as well as of the mosaics and stuccoes which embellish the
interior of the dome.</p>

<p>On reaching the summit, a panoramic view of Rome and the Campagna
is had, quite repaying the labour of the ascent.</p>

<h4>THE VATICAN.</h4>

<p>From the vestibule of S. Peter's we see, to the fullest advantage,
the fine piazza, with the Vatican on our left, which presents very
much the appearance of a large factory. Having been erected by
different architects in various eras, it has no systematic design, and
is, in fact, a collection of palaces built by different Popes. The
entrance is at the bend of the colonnade. <i>Permission to visit the</i>
<span class="smcap">Museum</span>, <span class="smcap">Galleries</span>, <span class="smcap">Library</span>, <i>&amp;c., must be obtained from Monsignor
Macchi, at his office, between the hours of 10 and 1, thus enabling a
party of five to pay a visit any day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and
festas, between 9 and 3, except the Museum of Statues, which is closed
every Thursday, when the Egyptian and Etruscan Museums and the
Gallery of Tapestries are only open</i>. The galleries are gained by</p>

<h4>THE SCALA REGIA,</h4>

<p>built in the pontificate of Urban VIII., from the design of Bernini.
The first flight is composed of Ionic columns, the second of pilasters.
The ornamental stucco work is from the designs of Algardi. The
equestrian statue of Constantine is by Bernini. On the first landing,
a passage leads to a small flight of steps. <i>At the top, on the right,
through a small red baize door, is the entrance to</i></p>

<h4>THE SISTINE CHAPEL,</h4>

<p>built by Sixtus IV. in 1473. It is celebrated for its paintings in
fresco by Michael Angelo; the roof alone occupied twenty months
in the painting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Roof.</span>&mdash;On the flat part are nine compartments illustrative of&mdash;(1)
The Separation of Light from Darkness; (2) Creation of the
Sun and Moon; (3) Land and Sea; (4) Adam; (5) Eve; (6) the Fall
and Expulsion (the figure of Eve is considered to be the most perfect
painting of the female form in existence); (7) the Sacrifice of Noah;
(8) the Deluge; (9) Noah inebriated. These are bordered by sitting
figures of prophets and sibyls: <i>over the altar</i>, Jonah; <i>on the left</i>,
Joel, the Sibyl Erithræa, Ezekiel, the Sibyl Persica, Jeremiah and
Zechariah; <i>on the right</i>, the Sibyl Lybica, Daniel, the Sibyl Cumæa,
Isaiah, and the Sibyl Delphica. In the four corners are&mdash;Moses lifting
up the Brazen Serpent, King Artaxerxes, Esther and Haman, David
and Goliath, Judith and Holofernes. In the arches over the windows,
and in the recesses, Genealogy of Christ from Abraham to
Joseph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Walls.</span>&mdash;Behind the altar is the great fresco of Michael
Angelo, representing the Last Judgment, designed by him when in
his sixtieth year, and completed in eight years (1540). <i>At the top</i>
is our Saviour, with the Virgin seated on his right, above angels
bearing the instruments of the passion. <i>On one side</i> of our Lord are
saints and patriarchs, and on the other martyrs. <i>Below</i>, a group of
angels sounding the last trump and bearing the books of judgment.
<i>On the right</i> is represented the fall of the condemned; Charon ferrying
some of them across the river Styx, striking the tumultuous with his
oar. The figure in the right-hand corner, representing Midas with ass's
ears, is Messer Biagio of Casena, the Pope's master of the ceremonies,
who said the nude figures were indecent; on which account the Pope
ordered Daniele da Volterra to cover them with drapery, which
obtained for him the cognomen of <i>Braghettone</i> (breeches-maker).
Michael Angelo said, "Let the Pope reform the world, and the
pictures will reform themselves." And to spite Biagio, he represented
him in hell, whereat he complained to the Pope in order
to have his figure removed. The Pope replied that as he was in
hell he must stop there, as he had no power to release from hell, but
from purgatory! <i>On the left</i>, the blessed are ascending to heaven
assisted by angels and saints.</p>

<p><i>Between the windows</i>, portraits of the Popes of the time, by the
artist of the subject below. The lower part of the walls is painted
in imitation of drapery, over which were hung on grand ceremonies
tapestries from Raphael's cartoons.</p>

<p><i>On the side walls</i> are scenes from the life of Moses typical of the
life of our Lord. <i>On entering, to the right</i>&mdash;

<p><i>Apply to the custodi of the Sistine Chapel to visit the Pauline
Chapel, which is entered from the</i></p>

<h4>SALA REGIA,</h4>

<p>built as an audience hall for the ambassadors to the Papal Court.
It is decorated with frescoes representing different important events
in Papal history.</p>

<h4>THE PAULINE CHAPEL</h4>

<p>was erected by Paul III. Its walls are painted in fresco, the conversion
of S. Paul and the execution of S. Peter being by Michael
Angelo. The painted roof and the portraits of twenty-eight Popes
are by Lorenzo Sabatini and Frederigo Zucchero.</p>

<p><i>Retracing our steps through the Sistine Chapel, and going up a narrow
stair, we enter, through a small white door, two rooms containing</i></p>

<h4>GALLERY OF MODERN PAINTINGS.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>First Room, right.</i>)</p>

<p>1. Beatitude of Benedict of Urbino (Capuchin).&mdash;Guido Guidi,
1865. He is being presented, with other missionaries, to Clement
VIII.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>2. Beatitude of John Sarcander, who is led to the torture by the
Dutch Calvinists.&mdash;By F. Grandi. 3. S. Chiara of Mount Falconi
visits Cardinal Colonna, who is kneeling.&mdash;Raffaele Gagliardi. 4. Alfonso
Rodosko's Vision of the Virgin.&mdash;By G. Sereni. 5. John
Berchmans' Vision of the Virgin.&mdash;Gagliardi. 6. Peter of Arbues,
Grand Inquisitor of Spain, murdered at the altar.&mdash;G. Mauretta.
<i>At the end</i> of this hall is a piece of tapestry designed by Raphael.
It represents S. Paul striking Bar-jesus (Elymas) blind before the
pro-consul Sergius Paulus at Paphos in Cyprus.&mdash;Acts xiii. 6. <i>Returning
up the hall.</i> 7. Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionist
Order.&mdash;Coghetti. 8. Declaration of the Dogma of Immaculate Conception
by C. de Paris. 9. The Virgin with the Infant Jesus appearing
to Maria degli Angeli, a Carmelite nun.&mdash;De Rohden.</p>

<p>The entry and the connection between the first and second hall
were once the chapel of Pius V. The richly-painted window, by
Ludovic Gesta of Toulouse, represents Germana Cousin, the Shepherdess
of Pibrac, crossing a stream, and portraits of Pius IX. and
French ecclesiastics. The cupola is the work of Federico Zuccheri;
the subjects are the Fall of Satan and scenes from the Life of Tobit.
In the lunettes below are the four doctors of the Latin Church, by
Paoletti.</p>

<p>(<i>Second Room, left.</i>) 10. Saints Martyred in Gorcum in the Netherlands.&mdash;Cæsar
Fracassini. His masterpiece; a very fine work of art.
11. A fine large painting, the gift of the Polish Roman Catholics.
It represents John Sobieski, King of Poland, relieving Vienna from
the Turks: the work of Matejko, 1883. 12. S. Lorenzo da Brindisi
leading the Imperial troops against the Turks at the Battle of Alba-Reale
in Hungary.&mdash;By F. Grandi. 13. S. Michael de' Sanctis.&mdash;Jojetti.

from these we go into the</i> <span class="smcap">Saloon of Podesti</span>, containing frescoes relating
to the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception. <i>On the end
wall</i> is represented the supposed Vision of the Virgin to Pius IX.;
<i>opposite</i>, the Discussion of the Dogma; <i>on the right wall</i>, Proclamation
of the Dogma. They were done in 1870, in commemoration of
the Vatican Decrees. <i>Thence we pass into the</i></p>

<h4>STANZE OR CAMERE OF RAPHAEL,</h4>

<p>consisting of four rooms designed by Raphael, and completed by his
pupils after his death, to illustrate the triumphs and establishment of
the Catholic Church. The principal frescoes are:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the First Room.</span>&mdash;<i>On the right</i>, the Incendio del Borgo, <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
847; <i>over the window</i>, Justification of Leo III.; <i>in front</i>, Victory of
Leo IV. over the Saracens at Ostia; and <i>opposite</i>, Coronation of
Charlemagne. The chiaro-oscuro portraits, <i>below</i>, by Caravaggio, represent
the princes who first gave tribute to the Church. The roof
is by Perugino, Raphael's master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;Illustrative of Theology, <i>on the entry wall</i>; Poetry,
<i>over the window</i>; Philosophy, <i>in front</i>; and Jurisprudence, <i>on the
right</i>. Representations of the Fall of Man, the Flaying of Marsyas,
the Study of the Globe, the Judgment of Solomon, <i>on the ceiling</i>. <i>On
the walls</i> corresponding&mdash;the Dispute on the Sacrament, Mount Parnassus,
the School of Athens (a portico crowded with philosophers,
which gives its name to the room), Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Room.</span>&mdash;<i>In front</i>, the Miraculous Expulsion of Heliodorus
from the Temple; <i>on the right</i>, the Mass of Bolsena; <i>on the entry
wall</i>, Attila driven back from Rome by Leo I.; <i>over the left window</i>,
S. Peter's Release from Prison (notice the four different lights here).
<i>The ceiling</i> represents subjects from the Old Testament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Room.</span>&mdash;<i>On the right</i>, Battle between Constantine and
Maxentius at the Ponte Molle; <i>entry wall</i>, Baptism of Constantine;
<i>left wall</i>, Rome presented by Constantine to Silvester; <i>in front</i>, the
Cross appearing to Constantine (the dwarf is Gradasso da Norcia,
from Berni's Poetry); <i>on the vault</i>, the pagan statue thrown down
represents the Triumph of Faith, by Lauretti (notice the wonderful
bit of perspective here); <i>on the right-hand corner, a door leads into the</i>
<span class="smcap">Anticamera of the Stanze</span>, originally painted by Raphael, restored
by Carlo Maratta. <i>Out of this room is</i></p>

<h4>THE CHAPEL OF S. LORENZO.</h4>

<p>The frescoes are by Fra Angelico, representing events in the lives
of SS. Stephen and Laurence. <i>On the ceiling</i> are the four Evangelists.
It was built as the private chapel of Nicholas V., and is the
oldest decorated portion of the Vatican. <i>We now pass into</i></p>

<h4>THE LOGGIE OF RAPHAEL,</h4>

<p><i>to the right on entering</i>.</p>

<p>"It is impossible either to execute or imagine a more beautiful
work" (Vasari). It is called Raphael's Bible. It is divided into
thirteen arcades, each containing four subjects of Scripture history&mdash;1.
The Creation of the World, by Raphael; 2. History of Adam and
Eve; 3. The History of Noah, by Giulio Romano; 4. Abraham and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Lot; 5. History of Isaac, by Penni; 6. Jacob, by Pellegrino; 7.
Joseph; 8. Moses, by Giulio Romano; 9. Moses, by Raffaello del
Colle; 10. Joshua; 11. David, by Pierino del Vaga; 12. Solomon,
by Pellegrino; 13. From the New Testament, by Giulio Romano.
The stucco ornaments and arabesque work are by Giovanni da
Udine, from Raphael's designs, who took the idea from the Golden
House of Nero. The weather has very much damaged them. Pius
IX. put the glass windows in.</p>

<p><i>The other sides</i> were built by Gregory XIII., and executed by
Giovanni da Udine; they have recently been restored by Mantovani.
<i>The farther one</i>, parallel with the Papal apartments, is where his holiness
gives audience.</p>

<p><i>A flight of stairs on the left leads to the</i> Upper Loggia, painted with
maps and landscapes. <i>Entrance to the Picture Gallery&mdash;ring the bell
at the second door on the left of the Central Loggia.</i></p>

<h4>THE PICTURE GALLERY.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>The Pinacotheca.</i>)</p>

<p>Formed by Pius VII. As the artist's name and the subject are
painted on the frame of each picture (a hint some of the other galleries
might adopt), it will be only necessary to mention the most
important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room.</span>&mdash;The Christian Mysteries, one of Raphael's earliest
paintings; Faith, Hope, and Charity, three medallions, by Raphael;
Doubting Thomas, by Guercino; Marriage of S. Catherine of Alexandria
with the Infant Christ, by Murillo; Adoration of the Shepherds,
by Murillo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;The Last Communion of S. Jerome, by Domenichino;
Madonna di Foligno, by Raphael; The Transfiguration,
Raphael's masterpiece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Room.</span>&mdash;S. Sebastian, by Titian; The Assumption of the
Virgin, in two parts&mdash;the Crowning, by Giulio Romano, and the
Apostles round the Tomb, by Francesco Penni; Virgin and Child,
by Sassoferrato; The Entombment, by Caravaggio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Room.</span>&mdash;S. Peter's Crucifixion, by Guido; Annunciation,
by Baroccio; Christ Enthroned, by Correggio.</p>

<h4>THE MOSAIC MANUFACTORY.</h4>

<p><i>Orders must be obtained from the Rev. Monsignor Fiorani, at the
Sacristy.</i></p>

<p><i>It is entered by a corridor from the ground floor at the left-hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
corner of the Court of S. Damaso.</i> The mosaics in S. Peter's, S. Paul's,
and other churches, were manufactured here. Some mosaics take
a long time to execute, as great patience and art are required in
blending the shades, &amp;c., upwards of 27,000 different shades of the
coloured <i>vetri</i> being kept in stock.</p>

<p>A plate, generally of metal, of the required size, is first surrounded
by a margin rising about three-quarters of an inch above the surface.
A mastic cement, composed of powdered stone, lime, and linseed oil,
is then spread over as a coating, perhaps a quarter of an inch in
thickness. When set, this is again covered with plaster-of-Paris
rising to a level with the margin, upon which is traced a very careful
outline of the picture to be copied, and just so much as will admit of
the insertion of the small pieces of smalto or glass is removed from
time to time with a fine chisel. The workman then selects from the
trays, in which are kept thousands of varieties of colour, a piece of
the tint which he wants, and carefully brings it to the necessary
shape. The piece is then moistened with a little cement, and
bedded in a proper situation, the process being repeated until the
picture is finished, when the whole, being ground down to an even
face and polished, becomes an imperishable work of art. The process
is the same for making the small mosaics so much employed at
the present day for boxes, covers, or articles of jewellery, and this
work is sometimes upon almost a microscopic scale. The Florentine
mosaic, which is chiefly used for the decoration of altars and tombs,
or for cabinets, tops of tables, coffers, and the like, is composed of
precious materials, in small slices or veneers, and by taking advantage
of the natural tints which characterize the marble, the agate,
or the jasper, very admirable effects may be produced in imitation
of fruits, flowers, or ornaments. The use of this kind of mosaic is
extremely restricted, on account of the great value and expense, not
only of the materials, but of the labour employed upon them. None
but the hardest stones are used; every separate piece must be
backed by thicker slices of slate or marble to obtain additional
strength; and every minute portion must be ground until it exactly
corresponds with the pattern previously cut.</p>

<h4>THE VATICAN MUSEUM.</h4>

<p><i>Open every day from 9 till 3, except on Thursday and Saturday,
when it is closed. Permission must be obtained of Monsignor Macchi, at
his office in the Vatican, from 10 till 1. Each permit admits a party
of five, and can only be used once.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p><i>Entrance</i> is obtained by going round to the back of S. Peter's,
thus enabling us on our way to admire the vast proportions of the
latter. The Vatican Museum was founded by Julius II., and consists
of those objects of art that have been discovered, and which
once graced the principal buildings of ancient Rome. At the
entrance the new official English catalogue by Signor Massi, the
conservator of the galleries, can be purchased; it gives a full account
of the objects of art. In so vast a collection, we call attention to the
principal works only.</p>

<p><i>Entering on the left by the iron gates, filled in with glass, and
ascending the marble stairs, we enter</i></p>

<h5>THE HALL OF THE GREEK CROSS.</h5>

<p>In the centre of the floor is a splendid mosaic, found at the Villa
of Cicero. A bust of Minerva forms the centre, around which are
twelve planets and various phases of the moon. The outer circle
(modern) is composed of masks and figures. The principal statues
are 559 and 597, Augustus; 564, Lucius Verus; 565, Hercules; 574,
Venus of Cnidos; 566, <i>left</i>, red porphyry Sarcophagus, which contained
the remains of Constantia, the daughter of Constantine the

the Christian emperor. (See <a href="#Page_327">page 327</a>
.) Before the door is a fine
mosaic representing a faun watering a flower. At the foot of the
stairs, by two sphinxes, is a beautiful basket of flowers in mosaic.
<i>We now enter</i></p>

<h5>THE ROTUNDA.</h5>

<p>Erected by Simonetti, by order of Pius VI. In the centre is a
magnificent vase of red porphyry, 46 feet in circumference, found in
the House of Nero. The large mosaic represents combats between
Centaurs and Lapithæ, and nymphs carried on the backs of monsters;
in the centre, under the vase, is the head of Medusa. The border
represents the adventures of Ulysses, Neptune, and monsters. The
principal statues are 537, 538, Tragedy and Comedy; 539, Bust of
Jupiter; 540, Colossal statue of Antinoüs; 546, Statue of Ceres; 545,
Bust of Antinoüs; 544, Hercules, in gilt bronze, found in 1864 during

<i>in the following order, commencing on the left</i>:&mdash;</p>

<h5>MERCURY OF THE BELVEDERE.</h5>

<p>A most valuable piece of antique Greek sculpture, found near the
Baths of Titus in 1779. On the walls are bas-reliefs representing a
combat between Amazons and Athenians, and a sacred procession;
56, Priapus, the god of orchards; 57, Hercules.</p>

<h5>CANOVA'S CABINET.</h5>

<p>It contains three splendid works by this great modern master:

(defence), Damoxenus (attack).</p>

<h5>APOLLO BELVEDERE.</h5>

<p>One of the finest masterpieces of ancient Greek sculpture, discovered
at Porto d'Anzio towards the close of the fifteenth century&mdash;Apollo
in the attitude of turning the army of the Gauls into stone,
with the head of Medusa, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 278, as we are informed by the inscription
in bronze; it was restored erroneously. It is beautifully
described by Byron in "Childe Harold."</p>

<h5>CABINET OF THE LAOCOON.</h5>

<p>Found in the Baths of Titus in 1506. Pliny (xxxvi. 4) thus
describes it:&mdash;"A work which may be considered superior to all
others both in painting and statuary. The whole group&mdash;the father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the boys, and the awful folds of the serpents&mdash;were formed out of a
single block by Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus, natives of
Rhodes. Michael Angelo said, however, and it has since been
proved, that it is in three pieces."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Two serpents ... their destined way they take,</p>
<p>And to Laocoön and his children make:</p>
<p>And first around the tender boys they wind,</p>
<p>Then with their sharpened fangs their limbs and bodies grind.</p>
<p>The wretched father, running to their aid</p>
<p>With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;</p>
<p>Twice round his waist their winding volumes rolled,</p>
<p>And twice about his gasping throat they fold.</p>
<p>The priest thus doubly choked, their crests divide,</p>
<p>And towering o'er his head in triumph ride."</p>

ancient sun-dial, found in 1770 near the Colosseum. The view from
here has given to this balcony the name</p>

<h5>BELVEDERE.</h5>

<p>It commands a beautiful panoramic scene of Rome and the Campagna,
bounded by the distant Alban and Sabine Hills.</p>

<h5>VESTIBULE.</h5>

<p>The gray peperino sarcophagus was discovered in the tomb of
the Scipios on the Via Appia in 1780. It contained the remains of
Scipio Barbatus. When it was opened, two thousand years after his
death, the skeleton was found entire, with a ring upon one of the fingers.
The ring passed into the hands of the Earl of Beverley, and the bones
were removed to Padua by the Venetian senator, Angelo Quirini.
On the wall are inscriptions found in the tomb. A bust of the poet
Ennius surmounts the sarcophagus.</p>

<h5>THE TORSO</h5>

<p>of Hercules. The work of Apollonius, son of Nestor of Athens.
Found near the Theatre of Pompey. It is considered to be the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
perfect resemblance to human flesh, and was greatly admired by
Raphael and Michael Angelo, the latter declaring that he was its

artists, and several cabinets containing many interesting objects.</p>

<p><i>Ascending the stairs we reach, on the right</i>,</p>

<h4>THE HALL OF THE BIGA,</h4>

<p>adorned with several beautiful works of ancient art, the principal of
which is the Biga or chariot, only the body of which is ancient. The

<h4>THE ETRUSCAN MUSEUM,</h4>

<p>which contains various works of art brought from the ancient towns

In the corners of the room cinerary urns, found beneath a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
volcanic stratum between Albano and Marino: they are in the form
of huts, and still contain ashes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Room.</span>&mdash;A Roman Mercury in terra-cotta, found at Tivoli;
a wounded youth reclining on a couch, generally called Adonis.</p>

<h4>THE INQUISITION.</h4>

<p>Returning from the Museum, on reaching the colonnade of
S. Peter's, <i>turn off to the right</i>, through the middle of the colonnade.
Opposite is the Palazzo del S. Uffizio,&mdash;the Inquisition, which was
established here in 1536, and abolished by the Roman Republic in
1849. It is now used as a barrack, and the Inquisition holds its
meetings in the Vatican.</p>

<p>Passing at the back of the columns into the Borgo S. Michaele, and
<i>turning to the right</i>, we enter the Borgo S. Spirito. <i>On the left</i> is the
fine tower of the Church of S. Michaele in Sassia, in which Raphael
Mengs is buried. This name, Sassia, commemorates the Saxon
settlement founded in 727, and the word "borgo" comes from the
Saxon "burgh." <i>Beyond is</i></p>

<h4>THE PORTA S. SPIRITO,</h4>

<p>a massive gateway built by San Gallo in the walls erected by Leo IV.
round S. Peter's and the Vatican, whence the district inside is called
the Leonine City. <i>Outside the gate a steep ascent leads up to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h4>S. ONOFRIO&mdash;TASSO'S TOMB.</h4>

<p>This convent is for ever memorable in the history of Italian literature
as the place where Tasso died. The adjoining church, called
Girolmini, or Brothers of S. Jerome, built for the use of the monks,
was erected in 1429 <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, during the reign of Eugene IV. Tasso,
summoned to the Capitol to be crowned there as king of bards, died
in 1595, a short time after his arrival in Rome. He was buried in the
church without much ceremony, and his remains lay undisturbed in
a simple tomb on the left of the entrance until the year 1857, when
they were transferred to a chapel in the church expressly built for
their reception at the public expense. A fine statue of the poet by
Fabris is shown. In the convent garden is a tree called Tasso's Oak,
under which the author of "Jerusalem Delivered" used to sit in
pious meditation. The view of Rome and of the Sabine and Alban
Hills, with Soracte in the distance, is magnificent. The fresco of the
Virgin and Child over the door of the church, and three paintings
under the portico illustrating the life of S. Jerome, are the work of
Domenichino. In the convent is a Virgin and Child by Leonardo
da Vinci; and in the same building are preserved several relics of
Tasso, in the room where he died&mdash;his crucifix, his inkstand, and the
leaden coffin in which his bones reposed for two hundred and sixty-two
years&mdash;namely, till the time of his second burial. Two other
distinguished men were buried in S. Onofrio&mdash;Guidi, the poet, and
Cardinal Mezzofanti, the famous linguist.</p>

<p><i>At the bottom of the ascent, turn to the right, down the Via Lungara.
Some little distance down on the right is the</i></p>

to visitors in Rome if we enumerate the paintings most

<p>On the opposite side of the street, just beyond the Corsini Palace
entrance, in the Vicolo Stalle d'Corsini, is the</p>

<h4>TORLONIA MUSEUM.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Museo Torlonia.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Permission must be obtained from Prince Torlonia. Written application
should be made to the prince at his palace in the Piazza di
Venezia.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>A full catalogue of the Torlonia Museum has been written and
printed by Signor P. E. Visconti. Copies are lent for the use of
visitors. This grand collection of sculptures has been in course of
formation by Prince Torlonia during many years. Some of the
objects were found on his own property, others have been purchased
by him, and many of the most valuable works formerly belonged to
the Mosca, Cambral, Giustiniani, Ruspoli, and Randanini collections.
As containing works of art, it ranks next to the Vatican collection,
and is the finest private gallery in the world.</p>

<p>Amongst so many valuable and beautiful works of art it is almost
impossible to say what the casual observer should more particularly
notice. A day may be well and profitably spent amongst this admirable
collection. The lover of art will gain every information
from Visconti's excellent catalogue, whilst ordinary visitors can
stroll through and consult it for those objects which strike them
most. Venuses, the Muses, gods and goddesses, heroes and tales
of mythology, the emperors and their wives,&mdash;all are amply
illustrated here. Many of the objects are unique, and as there is
such a good printed catalogue lent, it is unnecessary for us to enumerate
the different objects.</p>

<p><i>Continuing down the Via Lungara, at a short distance is</i></p>

<h4>THE PORTA SETTIMIANA,</h4>

<p>said to have been an archway leading into a villa of Septimius Severus.
It was incorporated by Aurelian into the line of his walls, and fortified
by Honorius. Passing under the arch, the <span class="smcap">Via Garibaldi</span> <i>on
the right</i> leads to the garden-crowned height of</p>

<h4>S. PIETRO IN MONTORIO,</h4>

<p>which commands a magnificent view of Rome, its surroundings, and
the windings of the Tiber. The church was erected by Ferdinand
and Isabella of Spain, and is still under the protection of the crowned
head of Spain. In the court of the monastery is a small temple
formed of sixteen Doric columns, said to be erected over the spot
where the cross on which S. Peter was executed stood. Raphael's
Transfiguration was painted for this church, whence it was taken
by the French to adorn the Louvre. On its restoration to the Papal
authorities it was placed in the Vatican. The tomb of Beatrice Cenci
is to our left of the high altar, but no name is recorded on the stone.
The new Spanish Academy adjoins the church.

<h4>MARTIAL'S VILLA.</h4>

<p>The Government has recently acquired and thrown open to the
public these grounds, known as the Corsini Villa, which for its view
is one of the most charming sites in Europe, formerly the villa of
Julius Martialis described by his nephew ("Ep." iv. 64):&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE JANICULUM.</h4>

<p>The long narrow ridge which commands Rome on its western side
took its name from Janus (Virgil, "Æn." vii. 358), but, although fortified
by Ancus Martius, was not reckoned in the city. It was sometimes
called Mons Aureus, from the golden colour of its sandy soil.
From the fort on the summit a flag flying denoted that all was well;
but if the flag was hauled down, the enemy were in view. It was
this fort that Lars Porsena seized when Horatius defended the bridge
below.</p>

<h4>THE PAULINE FOUNTAIN,</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Fontana Paolina</i>,)</p>

<p>supplied by the ancient Aqua Trajana, which has its source in the
Lago di Bracciano, thirty-five miles from Rome. The fountain was
built out of the remains of the Temple of Minerva which stood in
the Forum of Domitian. <i>The road through the</i> <span class="smcap">Porta S. Pancrazio</span>
<i>leads to the</i></p>

<h4>VILLA PAMPHILI DORIA.</h4>

<p><i>Open on Monday and Friday afternoons; one-horse carriages not
admitted.</i></p>

<p>The villa&mdash;the most extensive and delightful of the Roman villas,
abounding in avenues and woods, fountains and cascades&mdash;is situated
on the summit of the Janiculum, it is supposed upon the site of a villa
of Galba. From the ilex-fringed terrace there is one of the best
views of S. Peter's; a lake supporting swans; a temple to the slain
amongst the besiegers of Rome in 1849&mdash;all of which must be seen to
be appreciated. "Galba was buried in his gardens, which are situated
on the Aurelian Way, not far from the city" (Eutropius, vii. 16).</p>

<p><i>Re-entering the city, and descending the hill by the new road, thence
by the Via delle Fratte, we reach the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. CECILIA,</h4>

<p>originally the house of the saint. To the right, on entering, is the
tomb of Adam Hereford, Bishop of London, who died in 1398. The
second chapel on the right is said to have been the bath-room, and
pipes may still be seen in the wall. Beneath the high altar is the
statue of S. Cecilia, representing her body as found in the Catacombs
of S. Calixtus, "not lying upon the back, like a body in a
tomb, but upon its right side, like a virgin in her bed, with her
knees modestly drawn together, and offering the appearance of sleep."
A golden circlet conceals the wound in her throat that caused her
death. The inscription is as follows: "Behold the body of the most
holy virgin Cecilia, whom I myself saw lying incorrupt in her tomb.
I have in this marble expressed for thee the same saint in the very
same posture of body.&mdash;Stefano Maderno." Thus, when Cardinal
Sfondrati restored the church, in 1599, was the body found in
her tomb just as it had been deposited there eight hundred years
before, after being found in the Catacombs by Paschal I.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. CHRISOGONO.</h4>

<p>Founded by Pope Sylvester, and rebuilt 1623. It has a fine old
<i>opus Alexandrinum</i> pavement, and the aisles are formed by twenty-two
columns, two in porphyry supporting the arch. A mosaic in the
tribune represents the Madonna and Child enthroned between
SS. James and Chrisogono. The ceiling was painted by Arpino.
<i>On the left of the piazza is the small street</i>, <span class="smcap">Monte di Fiore</span>, <i>in which
is the</i></p>

<h4>STAZIONE VII COHORTI DEI VIGILI</h4>

<p>(Roman firemen), remodelled and formed into seven watches by
Augustus. The building was discovered in 1866. <i>The custodian
conducts the visitor over, fee half a franc.</i> Descending the stairs we
enter a mosaic paved courtyard, with a well in the centre, and on
the right a small altar with mural paintings. There are several
other chambers, and a bath, with numerous inscriptions on the walls
scratched by the firemen during their idle moments.</p>

<p><i>Going down the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Lungaretta</span>, <i>we enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Piazza of S. Maria</span>,
in which are a fine fountain and the</p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. MARIA.</h4>

<p>The façade is covered with mosaics representing the Virgin and
Child enthroned, surrounded by ten virgins, and on either side the
figure of a bishop (Innocent II. and Eugenius III.); above this are
palms, the twelve sheep, and the mystic cities, and our Lord enthroned
between angels. The interior contains twenty-two columns. The
Assumption, on the ceiling, is by Domenichino. Beneath the high
altar are the remains of five early popes. In the upper part of
the tribune are mosaics of the Saviour and a female figure (representing
the Church, the bride of Christ, and not the Virgin, as is
generally said) seated on thrones; beneath are lambs, and representations
from the life of the Virgin.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the church, and going down the</i> <span class="smcap">Via della Scala</span>, <i>hence
turning to the right into the Via di Ponte Sisto</i>, the house on the
left, a baker's shop, with Gothic upper windows, was the <span class="smcap">House
of Raphael's Fornarina</span>. <span class="smcap">Raphael's House</span> was at No. 124 Via
dei Coronari, near the S. Angelo Bridge. <i>A short distance, and we
reach</i></p>

<h4>THE PONTE SISTO.</h4>

<p>The present bridge was built by Pope Sixtus IV., who laid the
foundation stone, April 29, 1473, on the site of an older bridge which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
was destroyed in the flood of <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 792, it having been built by Symmachus,
prefect of Rome under Valentinian (<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 365), "under whose
government the most sacred city enjoyed peace and plenty in an
unusual degree; being also adorned with a magnificent and solid
bridge which he constructed, and opened amid the great joy of his
ungrateful fellow-citizens" (Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvii. iii. 3).
In 1878, in making the new embankment for the Tiber, the remains
of the left arch were found at the bottom of the river, upon which
was part of the inscription, one foot seven inches high&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valentinian</span>.
Pedestals which formed part of the decorations were also found, and
part of an inscription&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valentiniani au costi</span>. At the Campus
Martius end was a triumphal arch dedicated to Valens and Valentiniani&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE FARNESE PALACE.</h4>

<p>In the piazza are two fountains, the granite basins of which were
found in the baths of Caracalla. The palace is not now to be visited,
as it is occupied by the French Embassy. Its architecture is more
admired than that of any other palace in Rome; it was built by
Pope Paul III. with materials taken from the Colosseum. Its rooms
are adorned with frescoes of Annibale Caracci, his finest works, consisting
of mythological subjects. The centre piece represents the
Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne.</p>

<p>one of the finest palaces in Rome, built out of the travertine taken
from the Colosseum: the forty-four red granite columns which support
the portico came from Pompey's Theatre. At the foot of the
staircase Count Rossi was assassinated in November 1848.</p>

<h4>THE STATUE OF PASQUINO,</h4>

<p>a mutilated torso found here in the sixteenth century. It took its
name from Pasquino, a tailor, who lived opposite, and whose shop
was the rendezvous of the wits of the city, who wrote their jokes
and stuck them on the statue: these were replied to by the statue
of Marforio, now in the Capitol Museum.</p>

<p>Some of Pasquino's sayings were very witty, and have been published.
Now, under a free government, he seldom speaks.</p>

<p>containing three paintings by Rubens; they are at the high altar.</p>

<p><i>From the Statue of Pasquino, by the side of the Braschi Palace, we

<h4>CIRCO AGONALE,</h4>

<p>one of the finest squares in Rome, sometimes called Piazza Navona.
It takes its name from being the site of the Circus Agonalis. <i>Fêtes</i>
are held here during Carnival, and a fair at the Epiphany.</p>

<p>Notice the three fountains&mdash;the centre one by Bernini: four
figures, representing four rivers, recline on a craggy rock; on its
top stands an Egyptian obelisk, at its base a lion and a sea-horse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<h4>THE OBELISK.</h4>

<p>This, from the inscription, was either made for, or the inscription
was added to and imitated by, Domitian:&mdash;"Sun god. Son of the
Sun god. Supporter of the world. Giver of life to the world. The
man-god Horus. The son of the woman Isis, who is come to avenge
the death of his ancestor Osiris. The king living for ever, Domitianus."
From his Alban Villa, where it originally stood, it was
transported, in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 311, to the spina of the Circus of Maxentius on
the Via Appia, thence to its present site.</p>

<p><i>On the left is</i></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. AGNESE,</h4>

<p>said to have been built on the site where S. Agnes was exposed
after her torture; the high altar in the subterranean chapel is said
to stand on the very spot. In another part is shown her prison, and
where she was beheaded and burned, the church occupying the side
vaults of the circus. The upper church contains eight columns of
red Cortanella marble; it is ornamented with stuccoes, statues, alto-reliefs,
and pictures. Behind the high altar is the sepulchral chapel
of Princess Mary Talbot, wife of Prince Doria, who died in 1857.</p>

<h4>THE VIA RIPETTA.</h4>

<p>From the Piazza del Popolo the line of the Ripetta runs between
the Corso and the Tiber. In the house at the corner lived
Ciceruacchio. A short way down is the Quay of the Ripetta,
built in 1707 by Clement XI., and partly destroyed by the modern
iron bridge, over which is a direct walk to S. Peter's, the site of the
fields which formerly belonged to Cincinnatus (Livy, iii. 26).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h4>THE MAUSOLEUM OF AUGUSTUS.</h4>

<p><i>Turning out of the Ripetta on the left into the Via de' Pontefici,
through a gateway on the right</i>, are the remains of this once handsome
tomb; only the double reticulated wall, on which the tumulus with
its trees formerly stood, remains. This ruin has been converted into
a modern theatre, and thus the original finely-proportioned arrangements
can no longer be traced. A part of the enclosure wall may be
best seen from the court of the Palazzo Valdambrini, <i>102 Via Ripetta</i>.
The mausoleum was built by Augustus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 27. Marcellus, Agrippa,
Drusus, and Germanicus were buried there. Strabo describes it as
standing upon a lofty substruction of white stone, and shaded up to the
top with trees. The summit was crowned with the statue of Augustus
in bronze, and there were two Egyptian obelisks at the entrance,
brought over by Claudius. They are mentioned likewise by Marcellinus.</p>

<p><i>It stood in</i></p>

<h4>THE CAMPUS MARTIUS,</h4>

<p>which Strabo thus describes: "The plain, adorned by nature and
art, is of wonderful extent, and affords an ample and a clear space for
the running of chariots, and other equestrian and gymnastic exercises.
It is in verdant bloom throughout the year, and is crowned by hills
which rise above the Tiber and slope down to its very banks. The
whole affords a picturesque and beautiful landscape, which you would
linger to behold. Near to this plain is another of less magnitude;
and all around it are innumerable porticoes and shady groves, besides
three theatres, an amphitheatre, and various temples contiguous to
each other, so that the rest of the city appears only an appendage to
it." This lesser plain occupied the space between the Mausoleum
of Augustus and the Theatre of Marcellus&mdash;the plain from the
tomb to the modern Ponte Molle. "Sylla's monument stood in the
Campus Martius" (Plutarch).</p>

<p>It is one of those medieval watch-towers that come upon one so
unexpectedly in all sorts of out-of-the-way places in Rome. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Romans call it the Tower of the Monkey, from a legend that years
ago the proprietor kept a monkey. This monkey one day seized
upon a baby in the street below, and carried it to the top of the
tower, to the agony of the parents, who vowed a shrine to the Virgin
if the child were safely restored. No sooner was the vow uttered
than the monkey brought down the baby by means of the water-pipe.
The shrine was forthwith erected, and every evening the
lamp is lighted at <i>Ave Maria</i>, and shines like a bright star till
dawn.</p>

<h4>THE OBELISK</h4>

<p>surmounts a fountain. This obelisk and the one in the Piazza Minerva
were erected as pairs in Rome. They stood before the Temple
of Isis and Serapis in the Campus Martius. There is a small relief
in the Villa Ludovisi, representing in its background a temple with
four Ionic columns, and to the left an Egyptian obelisk. In the
foreground, to the left, is the figure of Minerva, fronting a reclining
female figure holding a vessel full of ears of corn (Isis?). By her side
is Cupid, and at their back a figure holding something in a spread-out
cloth. May not the temple in the background represent the
Temple of Isis and Serapis?</p>

<h4>THE PANTHEON.</h4>

<p>This incomparable circular edifice, originally intended by Agrippa
to form the conclusion of his thermæ,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> with which it is intimately
connected, is one of the noblest and most perfect productions
of that style of architecture specifically denominated Roman.
When the first wonderful creation of this species came into existence,
the founder of this glorious dome appears to have himself
shrunk back from it, and to have felt that it was not adapted
to be the every-day residence of men, but to be a habitation for
the gods.</p>

<p>The Church of S. Maria ad Martyres was originally the sudatorium,
or sweating-room, of the baths of Agrippa, being similar
in construction to all the sweating-rooms now existing, notably one
in the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli. It exactly answers Vetruvius's
description of this department of the baths. It seems afterwards to
have been dedicated as a temple of the gods, or Pantheon of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Julian line, according to Dion Cassius (liii. 27), when the portico was
added in the third consulship of Agrippa.</p>

<p>The straight vertical joint where the Greek portico has been built
up to the Roman body can be distinctly seen, and the pediment and
entablature can be observed behind the portico. It was burned in
the fire under Titus; and was restored, as the inscription on the
architrave tells us, by Septimius Severus and Caracalla&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">

PANTHEUM VETUSTATE CORRUPTUM CUM OMNI CULTU RESTITVERUNT.</p>
</div>

<p>Recent explorations have shown that in front of the Pantheon was
a large enclosure surrounded by a covered arcade, somewhat after
the manner of the colonnade at S. Peter's,
and entered by an arch of triumph. Remains
of this arch exist under the houses
in front of the Pantheon, which are to be
pulled down.</p>

<p>When Agrippa dedicated the Pantheon
as a temple, it was consecrated to Jupiter
the Avenger. "Some of the finest works
that the world has ever beheld ... the roofing
of the Pantheon of Jupiter Ultor that
was built by Agrippa" (Pliny, "N. H."
xxxvi. 24). The repairs commenced by
Septimius Severus and Caracalla were
completed by Alexander Severus, who
built his baths close by. We call attention
to a coin of this emperor, which represents
the temple and its enclosure on the reverse; on the obverse
is the emperor's portrait, and the legend <span class="smcap">IMP . C . M . AVR . SEV .
ALEXANDER . AUG.</span> On the coin the columns are placed close on
either flank, and two are omitted, to show the seated statue of
Jupiter in the temple, which statue is now in the Hall of Busts in
the Vatican Museum, and is a copy of the celebrated Jupiter of
Phidias.</p>

<p>The fact that the Pantheon was originally built as a sudatorium
has been proved to a certainty by the excavations made in the sudatorium
of the Baths of Caracalla. There we have, as it were, the
Pantheon in ruins. It is slightly smaller, the diameter being 125
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
feet&mdash;17 less than the Pantheon. Opposite to the entrance is an apse,
and on each side there are three recesses, as at the Pantheon, which
were used as caldaria, but are now, in the Pantheon, chapels of the
saints.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i-191" id="i-191"></a>

</div>
<p>The portico is 110 feet long, and 44 feet deep. Sixteen Corinthian
columns, 46½ feet high and 5 feet
in diameter, support the roof. The
Pantheon was converted into a
church by Boniface IV. in 609, by
permission of the Emperor Phocas,
and it was dedicated to the martyrs
on November 1st (All Saints' Day),
830. The doors and grating above,
of ancient bronze, with the rim
round the circular opening in the
vault of the interior, are all that is
left of the ancient metal work.
The interior is 142 feet in diameter,
and 143 feet high, and is lighted
by an open space of 28 feet in
diameter. It is the burial-place of Raphael and of Victor Emanuel
II.&mdash;<i>right of high altar</i>.</p>

<p>Pliny says ("Nat. Hist." xxxvi. 4): "The Pantheon of Agrippa
has been decorated by Diogenes of Athens, and the caryatides by
him, which form the columns of that temple, are looked upon as
masterpieces of excellence. The same, too, with the statues that are
placed upon the roof, though, in consequence of the height, they
have not had an opportunity of being so well appreciated." "The
capitals, too, of the pillars which were placed by M. Agrippa in the
Pantheon, were made of Syracusan metal" (<i>ibid.</i>, xxxiv. 7). Marcellinus
(xvi. x. 14) says: "The Pantheon, with its vast extent, its
imposing height, and the solid magnificence of its arches, and the
lofty niches rising one above the other like stairs, is adorned with
the images of former emperors."</p>

<p>"It is as difficult to reconcile the statements of different authors
respecting the original idea of Agrippa, as it is hazardous to attempt
to prove the successive metamorphoses which the plan sketched by
the artist has undergone. This much, however, is certain, that with
respect to the modern transformation of the whole, the consequences
have been most melancholy and injurious. The combination of the
circular edifice with the rectilinear masses of the vestibule, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
all the pains bestowed, and the endless expenditure of the
most costly materials, has been unsuccessful; and the original design
of the Roman architect has lost much of its significance, or, at all
events, of its phrenological expression, by being united with ordinary
Grecian forms of architecture, which in this place lose great part of
their value. No one previously unacquainted with the edifice could
form an idea, from the aspect of the portico, of that wondrous structure
behind, which must ever be considered as one of the noblest
triumphs of the human mind over matter in connection with the law
of gravity.</p>

<p>"Conflagrations, earthquakes, sacrilegious human hands, and all the
injuries of time, have striven together in vain for the destruction of
this unique structure. It has come off victorious in every trial; and
even now, when it has not only been stripped of its noblest decorations,
but, what is still worse, been decked out with idle and unsuitable
ornaments, it still stands in all its pristine glory and
beauty.</p>

<p>"In order to obtain a notion of the size and solid excellence of the
work, it will be well first to make the circuit of the entire edifice.
We shall thus have an opportunity of admiring the fine distribution
of the different masses. After the first circular wall or belt,
which rests upon a base of travertine, has attained a height of nearly
forty feet, it is finished off with a simple cornice, serving as a solid
foundation for the second belt. As a preservative against sinking,
this is, moreover, provided with a series of larger and smaller construction
arches, alternating symmetrically with one another. After
rising some thirty feet, further solidity is given to the wall by a
girdle suitably decorated with consoles, and on this the third belt
(which is but a few feet lower) is supported. A similar number of
the arches already mentioned, introduced as frequently as possible,
enables this wall to support the weight pressing upon it, and to raise
the harmoniously rounded cupola boldly aloft.</p>

<p>"In ancient times the whole building, which is composed of brick,
was covered and embellished with a coating of stucco. On the upper
cornice, at the back, between the consoles, portions of terra-cotta
decorations still remain, seeming to have formed part of this ornamental
facing.</p>

<p>"In our examination of the interior, we are, unfortunately, much
hindered in our attempt to investigate the constructive connection of
the whole by the unmeaning ornamental additions, and the thoughtless
transformation of the different organic masses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>"So much, however, may be discovered even on a superficial survey&mdash;namely,
that the architect has everywhere endeavoured, not
merely to diminish the pressure on the walls of the lower belt (which
is nearly twenty feet thick) by inserting hollow chambers, but has
given them additional strength by means of the vaulted constructions
thus introduced. A hall, supported on pillars, lies between each of
the eight modern altars, and behind each of them, on the outside, are
niches, reached through the different doors, recurring at regular distances
throughout.</p>

<p>"The slabs of coloured marble belonging to the attica were carried
off some hundred years ago, under Benedict XIV., and their place
supplied by the present coulisse paintings. This polychrome system
would have greatly facilitated our researches into the coloured
architecture of the ancients, and its loss is therefore much to be
regretted.</p>

<p>"For, although this portion of the edifice was thus transformed at
a comparatively late period, still the effect of those finely harmonized
masses must have been a remarkable one.</p>

<p>"To judge from the combination of coloured stones still remaining
in this edifice, the effect must have been very rich and beautiful.
The elaborate capitals and bases of white marble must have formed
a fine contrast to the yellow shafts of the pillars and the stripe of
porphyry inserted in the architrave. The largest specimen of this
coloured mode of decoration has been preserved in the pavement;
although here also we must take it for granted that the original
arrangement has been disturbed, the sunken bases of the columns
sufficing to prove that the pavement has been raised in course of
time. This circumstance is not without optical reaction on the proportions
of the different masses. The horse-shoe arch over the
entrance-door is remarkable. It forms a striking contrast to that of
the tribune, where the projecting cornice rests upon two pillars,
whereas the architrave, broken through by the doorway, is supported
only by pilasters.</p>

<p>"The ædiculæ, now converted into altars, are covered in, partly
with gables, partly with arches, the former resting upon fluted
pillars of yellow marble, the latter upon porphyry pillars. The walls
behind are likewise faced with slabs of coloured marble, which, in
their original splendour, must have reflected the magnificence of the
pillars.</p>

<p>"The facing of the door is the only considerable portion still
remaining of the rich bronze-work with which this edifice was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
formerly fitted up. Simple as the decoration of these massive doors
now appears, it is yet imposing for such persons as are capable of
appreciating pure symmetry and a judicious distribution of the parts
in surfaces so extensive. The nails, with heads in the form of
rosettes, separating the different panels, are the only ornament. The
window above the door is closed by a grating composed of curves
placed one above the other, thus admitting both light and air. The
destruction of the bronze cross-beams which formed the roof of the
vestibule till the time of Urban VIII., is most to be regretted. This
was composed of bronze tubes, on precisely the same principle as
that on which Stephenson, a few years ago, constructed the bridge
over the Menai Straits.</p>

<p>"The cupola is nearly seventy feet in height, and rests on the attica,
corresponding to the second outer belt. This attica has suffered most
severely from modern alterations. The walls behind this afford
space for a series of chambers. The massive wall of the third belt,
on the other hand, surrounding the cupola to a third of its height, is
rendered accessible by a passage running round the whole; and this
again is spanned by frequently recurring arches, and lighted by the
windows visible on the outside.</p>

<p>"The diameter of the cupola is nearly equal to its height. The
round aperture at the top, by means of which the interior is lighted
with a magical effect, measures about twenty-eight feet in diameter.
Here is still to be seen the last and only remnant of the rich bronze
decorations of which this edifice formerly boasted. It consists of a
ring, adorned with eggs and foliage, encircling the aperture, and not
merely strengthening the edge of the wall, but constituting a graceful
and at the same time a simple and judicious ornament.</p>

<p>"It is certain that the five converging rows of gradually diminishing
cassettoni have been decorated in a similar manner, and it is
stated that vestiges of metal were discovered during the process of
whitewashing.</p>

<p>"The six niches between the altars are each supported by two fluted
pillars and a corresponding number of pilasters, the greater portion
of them being composed of monoliths of that costly yellow marble frequently
employed by the ancients. They are more than thirty-two
feet in height, and, as regards size, are unique of their kind. It has
been impossible, even for the ancients, to erect, of this rare material,
all the pillars required for the embellishment of this splendid edifice,
for which reason they were obliged to substitute six of pavonazzetto.
These, however, they stained, without injuring the brilliancy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
marble or the transparency of the grain, in such a manner as to bring
them into harmony with the other yellow masses, and to deceive
even the most practised eye. This circumstance is of great importance
in forming an opinion on the coloured architecture of the
Greeks, as it shows how they contrived to harmonize the white
marble masses without concealing the texture of the noble material.</p>

<p>"It is stated by Pliny that caryatides were placed here by a
certain Diogenes of Athens, corresponding to the pillars which support
the architrave.</p>

<p>"Apparently they were a free repetition of the caryatides of the
Pandrosium; and probably the statue in the Braccio Nuovo, which
was brought from the Palazzo Paganica, in the immediate neighbourhood
of the Pantheon, was one of these, the scale being precisely
adapted to this situation.</p>

<p>"Some of the large nails used in riveting the bronze plates
together are still preserved in the different museums. We are
indebted to Serlio, an architect of the sixteenth century, who preserved
a drawing of it, for the only information we possess concerning
this ingenious piece of mechanism. The Pope mentioned above,
a member of the Barberini family, had the barbarity to carry off
and melt down these important remains. An inscription on the left
of the principal door celebrates the judicious transformation of
these masses of bronze into cannons, and ornaments for churches"
(Braun).</p>

<p>Urban VIII. "That the useless and almost forgotten decorations
might become ornaments of the apostle's tomb in the Vatican temple,
and engines of public safety in the fortress of S. Angelo, he moulded
the ancient relics of the bronze roof into columns and cannons, in the
twelfth year of his pontificate" (Inscription).</p>

<p>"What the barbarians did not the Barberini have done" (Pasquino).</p>

<p>"On each side of the entrance to the Rotunda are two immense
niches, constructed of brick, in which the colossal statues of Augustus
and Agrippa are supposed to have been placed. This opinion seems
to me too hazardous, and contrary to the spirit of these two eminent
statesmen.</p>

<p>"Standing among the sixteen granite pillars supporting the vestibule,
we feel that there is something overpowering in the impression
it produces. This, however, diminishes when we step out upon the
piazza, which lies too high. At its original level, a flight of five
steps led up to the building; and the effect when viewed from a
distance must have been essentially different, as we may judge from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the portion of pavement which has been excavated to the right of
the Rotunda" (Braun).</p>

<h4>THE BATHS OF AGRIPPA.</h4>

</div>

<p>The houses built amidst the ruins of the Baths of Agrippa at the
back of the Pantheon have been demolished, and part of a large hall
has been exposed to view.
Nothing that has been discovered
is new to those
who have studied the subject.
It has long been
known that these houses
were built on the old walls
and vaults of the Thermæ.
In fact, the sacristy of the
Pantheon was made out of
a vaulted chamber, a floor
being inserted about half-way
above its base. Besides
the vaults and walls
now cleared, pavements,
pipes, and fragments of
pavonazzetto columns have
been found; also an earthenware jar containing 1,200 debased silver
coins&mdash;provincial money of the thirteenth century, with the motto,
<i>Roma caput mundi</i>. Portions of a beautiful frieze, formed with
tridents, shells, dolphins, and acanthus leaves, blended harmoniously
together, were found, and skilfully replaced in their ancient position.
It is almost impossible to say for what purpose this hall was used, as
nearly the whole of these baths are buried under the surrounding
houses; but judging from its relative position to the circular hall,
and from the plans of other thermæ, it was most probably the tepidarium.
The hall was 150 feet long by 70 feet wide. Oriental
marbles decorated the floor and walls, the latter being relieved with
niches containing statues. Through the central apse was the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
entry into the circular hall behind. The wall now exposed to view
has a large apse in the centre, with the platform, on which stood a
statue; and on either side are three niches for statues. Agrippa
served his first consulship in <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 717. He was ædile in 719&ndash;20.
In this service he built his baths. (Dion Cassius, in "Augustus;"
Pliny, xxxvi. 24.) In 726 he was consul for the second time. In
727 he was consul for the third time, when the circular hall of his
baths was turned into a temple, as we are informed by the inscription
<i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>These were the first large baths erected in Rome. Only small
fragments of them remain, built into the houses at the back of the
Pantheon, and so difficult to see. In the <span class="smcap">Via dell' Arco della Ciambella</span>,
some little distance back, are the remains of a circular hall.</p>

<p><i>The Via Minerva, to the left of the Pantheon, leads to the Piazza
Minerva.</i></p>

<h4>THE OBELISK,</h4>

<p>standing upon an elephant, stood, with the one in the square of the
Pantheon, in front of the Temple of Isis. The elephant upon which
it stands is the work of Ercole Perrata, and of course had nothing to
do originally with the obelisk. <i>On the left is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. MARIA SOPRA MINERVA,</h4>

<p>so named from being on the site of the Temple of Minerva dedicated
by Pompey. It is one of the few Gothic churches in Rome.</p>

<p>The interior is highly decorated in the Gothic style. Second
chapel on right, tomb of Princess Colonna. Fourth, the Chapel of
the Annunciation. Fifth, Aldobrandini Chapel. The Caraffa Chapel
contains a slab to a son of the late Bishop of Winchester, who joined
the Roman Catholic Church, and died at Albano in 1857. The
pictures of the Annunciation over the altar, the S. Thomas, and the
Assumption are fine.</p>

<p>The roof represents four sibyls surrounded by angels, by Raffaelino
del Garbo. The Altieri Chapel contains an altar-piece by C. Maratta.
Next is the tomb of Guillaume Durand, with a very fine
mosaic. Interesting to English visitors is the tomb of Cardinal
Howard, Great Almoner of England, who died at Rome in 1694. The
body of S. Catherine of Sienna reposes beneath the high altar. <i>On
the right</i> is Obicci's statue of S. John; and <i>on the left</i> Michael
Angelo's celebrated statue of the Saviour (the bronze drapery is an
addition). In the sacristy is a chapel formed from the walls of the
room in which S. Catherine died (1380). The festivals of S. Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Aquinas (March 7th) and of the Annunciation (March 25th) are
celebrated here with great ceremony.</p>

<p><i>On the left of the high altar</i> is the tomb of Fra Angelico, a monumental
slab of the artist-monk, standing, with clasped hands, within
an arch, in low relief.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF MINERVA CAMPENSIS</h4>

<p>was erected by Pompey the Great in celebration of his Eastern
victories. The cella was destroyed in the sixteenth century. In
making some alterations, in April 1874, in the houses to the right of
the church above, some remains of walls six feet thick, and having
stamps of repairs <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 123, were found. Remains can be seen <i>in the
court of the shop at the corner of the Piazzetta della Minerva and Via
del Piè de Marmo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Passing along the Via del Piè de Marmo, we reach</i> the piazza in
which is situated the <span class="smcap">Collegio Romano</span>, till recently the head-quarters
of the Jesuits. It has been sequestered by the Italian Government,
and the College is now carried on under the Government.</p>

<p><i>In the street to the right of the College is the entrance to</i> the <span class="smcap">Library

<p><span class="smcap">Entry Hall.</span>&mdash;In a case down the centre are many highly interesting
objects, mostly in bronze&mdash;early money, gems, styli, etc.
The <i>Glandes Missiles</i>, or lead sling-bullets, are unique; many of
them have messages cut upon them. In the cases against the wall are
many objects of interest. The second on the left contains <i>Silver Cups</i>
found at the Aquæ Aureliæ on Lake Bracciano, three of which have
itineraries from Cadiz to Rome engraved upon them. They are of
the times of Augustus, Vespasian, and Nerva, and are supposed to
have been thrown in by people who had made the journey and were
cured by the waters, as an offering to the <i>genii loci</i>.</p>

<p>An ancient mosaic forms the floor of the hall, and in a semicircle
at the end statuettes are grouped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room</span>, on the left of entry hall, is devoted to bronzes used
for domestic purposes, and to Lares and Penates. In the centre
of the room is the <i>Bisellium</i>, or chair of state, formed of bronze
inlaid with silver. It was found at Otimo. The <i>Cista Mistica</i>
was a prize given to gladiators to contain the requisites for
their toilets. Three eagles' claws pressing on toads form the feet.
Upon the cylindrical vase are engravings,&mdash;a gladiator stepping out
of a galley with the <i>cista</i> in his hand; Amycus being killed by Pollux,
the Argonauts looking on. It was found at Palestrina, where
several similar ones have recently been found. The handle is formed
by three figures with their arms entwined.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Room</span>, at end on left, contains the caricature found cut
in the plaster of the Domus Gelotiana of the Palatine&mdash;<i>the Skit of
the Crucifixion</i>. It represents the body of a man with an ass's head
being crucified. Below, on the left, is the figure of a man in adoration;
beneath, in Greek, "Alexamenos adores his God." The Romans
mixed up the Jews and the Christians; and believing that the former
worshipped a white donkey (Tacitus, "H." v. 3), they applied it to
the Christians, and in this way, because they knew the Christian's
God was crucified. Tertullian ("Apol." xvi.) says it was a common
caricature against the Christians. The date is about 200.</p>

<p>The inscriptions and reliefs are early Christian; also the objects in the
glass case. To the right, at the end of the entry hall, is the entry
to the Natural History and Pre-historic Museums. Passing through
these, or better, returning and passing by the entrance, we enter the

<h5>TREASURE TROVE AT PALESTRINA.</h5>

<p>Whilst some peasants were recently digging up their plot of ground
near the Church of S. Rocco they came upon a subterranean tomb,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
which, upon examination, was found to contain arms, shields, sacrificial
implements, jewellery, utensils, and other objects of value and
interest. We may remind our readers that Præneste was destroyed
by Sulla,&mdash;that is, the ancient city founded by the Greeks, and
surrounded by the Pelasgic wall. This tomb is of that period, and
measures five metres by three, and is composed of large blocks of
tufa, without cement. The vault had fallen in, and thus damaged
some of the objects, the principal of which are:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Personal Ornaments.</i>&mdash;1. An object which might be called a huge
fibula, as without doubt it was sewn on a dress. It is made of a
rectangular piece of solid gold, 0<sup>m</sup>.17 long, 0<sup>m</sup>.10 wide. The borders
and the central line are ornamented with bands, worked "a meandro,"
ending with lions' heads. On the flat surface <i>one hundred and thirty-one</i>
animals, such as lions, sphinxes, and sirens, stand or crouch.
The skill with which the gold is worked in the most microscopic details
is quite wonderful. 2. A fibula of gold, 0<sup>m</sup>.12 long, not different
from the Etrusco-Roman shape. 3. A few yards of a golden fringe
or <i>fimbria</i>, which trimmed the edge of the dress, and in which the
movable strings are attached to a band or heading, ornamented with
swallows and crows. 4. A stick of silver, which seems to have ended
with a hand, and might be considered as a sceptre. 5. Many clasps of
gold, on which are fixed couples of lions and sirens of the same material.</p>

<p><i>Utensils: Familiar or Sacred Supellex.</i>&mdash;1. The funeral-bed, with
the framework of oak-wood and the ornamentation of bronze. On
the junction of the four poles of the frame are groups of <i>telamones</i>,
whose heads are dressed with huge feathers, not unlike South
American caciques; chimeras carrying away human bodies; dogs
persecuting lions, &amp;c. 2. A kind of strong-box, inlaid with exquisite
bas-reliefs of ivory, coated in gold, and representing heads of monsters,
lions eating up bodies dressed in Eastern fashion, Egyptian
boats, females in priestly attire, battle-scenes between horsemen and
infantry, &amp;c. 3. Three cylinders, 0<sup>m</sup>.19 long, 0<sup>m</sup>.027 in diameter,
inside of which are concealed sticks of palm-wood. 4. Two tripods,
with their basins or <i>lebetes</i>, round the lips of which are human
figures and monsters looking inside. 5. Tazza of gold and silver,
0<sup>m</sup>.18 in diameter, with reliefs representing an Eastern king hunting
cynocephali, or some other kind of monkey. 6. Tazza of pure gold,
0<sup>m</sup>.12 high, in the shape of a Greek "skyphos," with handles ending
with winged male figures. 7. Several other cups of blue Ph&oelig;nician
glass, of gold and silver, and pure silver, one of which is exceedingly
interesting, as it bears the signature of the artist. The paleography
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of the letters resembles that of the stones of <i>Mesa</i> and <i>Esmunazar</i>;
and the text, taken as a whole, recalls to mind the signatures of the
cuneiform contracts discovered in Assyria, which belong to the
seventh century before Christ. And such is certainly the date of
the signature found at Palestrina, which has been interpreted by
Professor Fabiani, "Esmunie 'ar ben 'asta." The same philologist
thinks that the artist must be contemporary with, if not anterior to,
Euchyros and Eugrammos; and if so, Esmunie 'ar would be the
earliest goldsmith whose name is historically known, with the exception
of Bezaleel (Ex. xxxi.), <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 1491.</p>

<h4>THE PRE-HISTORIC MUSEUM</h4>

<p>contains many objects of interest. In it are arranged different articles
from various parts of the world, demonstrating how the same implements,
weapons, and customs were once universally used. The collection
of flints is one of the finest in the world, and to those interested
in this branch of archæology is of special value. Each case is labelled
with the names of the object and the country.</p>

<p><i>Thence passing into the Piazza del Gesù</i>, we can visit the</p>

<h4>CHURCH OF THE JESUITS (Il Gesu),</h4>

<p>one of the finest in Rome. Its interior is rich in stuccoes, paintings,
and sculptures. The frescoes of the tribune, the dome, and the roof
are by Baciccio. The Chapel of S. Ignatius is very fine; the columns
and ball over the altar are composed of lapis-lazuli. Beneath the
altar, in an urn of gilt bronze, is the body of the saint. The small
circular chapel close by is rich in paintings and stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>It is well worth a visit there to hear mass, vespers, or one of the
fathers preaching.</p>

<p>The wind generally blows in the piazza, which is thus accounted
for. One day the wind and the devil were out for a ramble; and,
on arriving at this square, the old gentleman asked the wind to stop
a moment while he went into the church. The wind is still stopping
for the devil, who has not yet come out.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Via Cesarini</span>, down the new Corso Vittorio Emanuele, leads
to the Piazza of S. Nicola a Cesarini. In the court of No. 56 is</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF CASTOR.</h4>

<p>The remains show that it was a circular building. It stood near the
Flaminian Circus. (Vitruvius, iv. 7.) Four fluted tufa columns exist.</p>

<p><i>From Piazza del Gesù we proceed up</i> <span class="smcap">Via Ara C&oelig;li</span>. <i>Before us is</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CAPITOLINE HILL.</h4>

<p>It was originally called the Hill of Saturn (Dionysius, ii. 1), being
occupied by Romulus as a defence for the Palatine Hill (Plutarch, in
"Rom."), and was betrayed to the Sabines by Tarpeia, the daughter
of the commandant of the fortress (Livy, i. 11). When the Palatine
and Capitoline Hills were united into one city, and the two kings
reigned together, the name of the hill was changed and called the
Tarpeian Hill. In the 138th year after the foundation of Rome,
when Tarquin the Great was making the foundations for the great
Temple of Jupiter, they found a human head; and the oracle told
them that the spot where the head was found should become the
head of the world; and so they changed the name of the hill again,
and called it the Capitoline Hill,&mdash;from <i>caput</i>, a head (Livy, i. 55;
Pliny, xxviii. 4). The whole hill was the Arx or Citadel of Rome,
just the same as at Athens, Veii, Tusculum, &amp;c. Several ancient
authors agree in this. The shape of the hill is a saddle-back,&mdash;the
centre being depressed, with an eminence at each end. The one on
our left is known as the Ara C&oelig;li height, and the one on our right
as the Caffarella height. On the Ara C&oelig;li height stood the great
Temple of Jupiter, facing south, and approached from the Area
Capitolina (Piazza del Campidoglio) by a flight of steps. On the
opposite or Caffarella height stood the Temple of Juno Moneta or
the Mint, and the Temple of Concord, both built by Camillus; and
the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius, founded by Romulus. Many other
temples, altars, and shrines occupied the space inside the citadel,
which was approached by three ascents upon its eastern side,&mdash;the
Clivus Capitolinus, the Pass of the Two Groves, and the Hundred
Steps. The ascents upon its western side date from 1348, when the
marble stairs on our left, leading up to the Ara C&oelig;li, were erected
out of the stairs that led up to the Temple of Quirinus (Romulus)
upon the Quirinal Hill. The ascent to the Square was made in 1536
for the entry of Charles V. The roadway on its right is quite recent.
In forming it some remains of the tufa walls that protected the arx
on this side were found, and can still be seen inside the iron gate.</p>

<p>On the balustrade at the bottom of the ascent to the Capitol are
two Egyptian lionesses. At the top of the ascent are two colossal
statues of Castor and Pollux, found in the Ghetto, and by their side
are the miscalled Trophies of Marius. They belonged to the decorations
of the Nymphæum of Alexander Severus, the picturesque ruins
of which are on the Esquiline Hill, and which are represented on a coin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
They were placed upon the balustrade of the Capitol, their present
site, by Pope Sixtus V. Originally they formed part of the ornamentation
of the Basilica Ulpia, and were erected in honour of Trajan by
the Apollinarian and Valerian legions. Next to the trophies are
two statues of Cæsar and Augustus Constantine; and in the same
row, on the left, the stone that marked the seventh and, on the right,
the stone that marked the first mile on the Via Appia.</p>

<p><i>In the centre of the Square is</i></p>

<h4>THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF MARCUS AURELIUS,</h4>

<p>the finest piece of bronze work of ancient times. It now stands upon
the Square of the Capitol, where it was erected by Michael Angelo
in 1538. Before that, it stood at the Lateran, where it had been
placed in 1187, having been taken from near the Column of Phocas
in the Forum. It belongs to the canons of the Lateran, who receive
yearly, in the shape of a bouquet of flowers, a peppercorn rent for it
from the mayor of Rome. It is said that Michael Angelo on passing
by used to say, "Gee up, <i>cammina</i>;" and that the horse had only to
plant the raised hoof upon the ground to complete the illusion that
it was a living creature.</p>

<p>In front of us is the mayor's residence; on the left the Museum
of the Capitol; and on the right the halls of the town council.
These buildings were erected by Michael Angelo in 1544&ndash;1550. The
residence for the senator was first erected on the top of the ruins of
the Tabularium in 1389&ndash;1394 by Pope Boniface IX., but this gave
place to the present edifice.</p>

<p>The ascent from the Arch of Severus to the Square of the Capitol
was anciently the Pass of the Two Groves. At the top of the pass
was the Gate of Janus, the gate of the citadel, betrayed by Tarpeia.
The ascent from the Forum, on our right, was the Clivus Capitolinus,
a continuation of the Via Sacra. It is only at its termination that
the present road is on the site of the ancient slope, where some of
the pavement may still be seen. The gate which here gave access
to the arx was called the Gate of Saturn.</p>

<p><i>On the right</i> of the old museum some steps lead up to</p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF ARA C&OElig;LI.</h4>

<p>The nave is formed by twenty-two columns, the spoils of ancient
buildings. The third one on the left has engraved upon it&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">

nave are two Gothic ambones with mosaic work. The altar urn of
red porphyry formerly, it is said, contained the body of Constantine's
mother. This church is rendered famous as being the place where,
on the 15th of October 1764, Gibbon "sat musing amidst the ruins
of the Capitol, and conceived the idea of writing the 'Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire.'"</p>

</div>

<p>The church is the residence of the celebrated Santissimo Bambino,
carved out of a tree from the Mount of Olives, and painted by S.
Luke. This image is highly decorated with jewellery, and has a
two-horse carriage at its disposal, with coachmen and footmen, when
it pays a visit to the sick. "As thy faith, so be it unto thee."
Apply at the sacristy to see it. The floor of the church is of the
kind called <i>opus-Alexandrinum</i>, tesselated mosaic, and slab tombs
of medieval period. A grand ceremony is held here on Christmas
day, and at the Epiphany children recite the story of Christ.</p>

<p>In the left transept an isolated octagonal chapel, dedicated to
S. Helena, is said by the church authorities to stand on the site of an
altar erected by Augustus&mdash;<i>Ara primogeniti Dei</i>&mdash;to commemorate
the Cumæan sibyl's prophecy of the coming of the Saviour. Its
present name is traceable to this altar. Some traces of Gothic
can be seen in the walls and windows of this church, which stands
on the site of</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER CAPITOLINUS.</h4>

<p>"It stood upon a high rock, and was 800 feet in circuit, each side
containing near 200; the length does not exceed the width by quite
15 feet. For the temple that was built in the time of our fathers,
upon the same foundations with the first, which was consumed by
fire, is found to differ from the ancient temple in nothing but in
magnificence and the richness of the materials, having three rows of
columns in the south front, and two on each side. The body is
divided into three temples, parallel to one another, the partition
walls forming their common sides. The middle temple is dedicated
to Jupiter; and on one side stands that of Juno, and on the
other that of Minerva. And all three have but one pediment
and one roof." (Dionysius, iv. 61. See also Tacitus, "Hist." iii.
72; Livy, i. 55; Plutarch, in "Publicola;" Tacitus, "Hist." iv.
53.)</p>

<p>Four different temples have been erected on this site, and now it
is occupied by a Christian church. The first, built by Tarquinius
Superbus, and consecrated by Horatius the consul, was burned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the civil war. The second, erected by Sylla, and consecrated by
Catulus, was destroyed under Vitellius. The third, erected by
Vespasian, was burned before it was consecrated. The fourth was
built by Domitian.</p>

<p>Access is now to be had to some curious vaults below the convent,
which were formerly closed by the monks. Supporting these vaults
are some remains of massive tufa walls&mdash;one piece in particular being
about 36 feet long and 8 feet high&mdash;consisting of single blocks of stone,
of which the other fragments seem to be continuations. These appear
to have been built originally as substructions, and run parallel
with the Via Marforio, and could not have been part of the city
wall, for that is within the city of the two hills. Nibby records
that tufa walls remain under the stairs leading up to the Ara C&oelig;li
Church. We think them to be part of the foundations of the celebrated
Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.</p>

<p>We may mention that among the rubbish contained in the vaults
of the convent are two slender columns of Pentelic marble. May
not these have belonged to the temple?</p>

</div>
<p>The strongest evidence of the position of the Temple of Jupiter
"supremely good and great" is pictorial. We have it represented on
the relief in the Palazzo dei Conservatori which formed part of the
Arch of Marcus Aurelius. That emperor is there, after a victory,
offering sacrifice upon the Capitoline Hill;
and in the background is a representation
of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus: it
has three doors, and the figures of Minerva,
Jupiter, and Juno. This is to the spectator's
left, and faces south, as we are told
the temple faced. This relief is further
corroborated by another in the Louvre, in
the background of which is likewise a representation
of a temple of the Corinthian
order, facing the same way and to the left
of the spectator, and having over the door
the words <span class="smcap">Iovi Capitolinus</span>. Upon a relief in the Capitol Museum,
another building appears upon a lower level, ornamented with pilasters,
having Doric capitals. This building corresponds with the
front of the Tabularium towards the Capitol.</p>

<p>To the right of the Palazzo dei Conservatori (New Museum) a
road, through a gate, leads to the German Embassy. In the garden
Bunsen found the remains of the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
have lately been covered in; but a fine piece of the wall of the
Temple of Juno may yet be seen. <i>By applying at the Embassy,
permission will be given to enter the garden.</i></p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF JUPITER FERETRIUS (The Trophy-Bearer).</h4>

<p>The first temple built in Rome by Romulus, to receive the spoils
captured from Acron, King of Cænina.</p>

<p>"After the procession and sacrifice, Romulus built a small temple,
on the top of the Capitoline Hill, to Jupiter, whom the Romans
call Feretrius. For the ancient traces of it still remain, of which
the longest sides are less than fifteen feet" (Dionysius, ii. 34. See
Livy, i. 10).</p>

<p>It was enlarged <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 121 (Livy, i. 33); and was repaired by
Augustus on the advice of Atticus (Nepos. See Livy, iv. 20).</p>

<p><i>Opposite the gate leading into the garden</i> we can look over the
parapet, down the scarped rock, to the base beneath, which is reached
from below by <i>taking the Via Tor dei Specchi on the right, looking
towards the Capitol, and the Vicolo Rupe Tarpeia on the left</i>. It was
here that the terrible scene described in Hawthorne's "Transformation"
took place.</p>

<p>The road leads to the New German Archæological Institute. It
was about here that the messenger from Veii got into the citadel,
and where the Gauls tried to do the same, when the sacred geese
in Juno's temple awoke the garrison. The two bronze "geese"
shown in the Hall of the Conservators are
ducks.</p>

<p><i>Passing on under the archway, turn to the
left; at a little distance the Via Monte Tarpeia
turns off to the right&mdash;follow this; at the
end, the house facing us is built up</i> against the
point of the hill used for the public executions.</p>

<h4>THE TARPEIAN ROCK.</h4>

</div>
<p>After the name of the hill was changed
for the last time, one part, we are told, retained
the name of the Tarpeian Rock, from
being the burial-place of Tarpeia, and the
spot from which the traitors were hurled
off in sight of the people assembled in the Forum. The house in
front of us is built upon a ledge of the rock below, and has upon
it the following inscription:&mdash;

<p>"The quæstors led the man [Spurius Cassius] to the top of the
precipice that commands the Forum, and in the presence of all the
citizens threw him down from the rock. For this was the established
punishment at that time among the Romans for those who were condemned
to die"&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 269&mdash;(Dionysius, viii. 78).</p>

<p><i>If we look back up</i> the street we came down, the height will be
seen in the garden above us. It must be remembered that the top
of the hill has been levelled, and the valley below filled in thirty feet;
allowing for this there would have been a fall of upwards of 160
feet. The steps on our left formed the third ancient approach to
the arx, the <i>Centum Gradus</i>, up which the Vitellians climbed when
they took the citadel. On the site of the garden above stood</p>

<h4>CAMILLUS'S TEMPLES TO CONCORD AND JUNO.</h4>

<p>The first Temple of Concord of which we have any notice was that
dedicated by Camillus, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 388.</p>

<p>"When the dictator was one day sitting on the tribunal in the
Forum, the people called out to drag him from his seat; but he led
off the patricians to the senate house. Previous to his entering it
he turned towards the Capitol [this shows that the senate house
was not on the Capitol, as some would have us believe; for if so, he
would not have turned towards the Capitol before entering the
senate house&mdash;he would have already faced it], and besought the
gods to put a happy end to the present disturbances, vowing to build
a temple to Concord when the tumult should be appeased.... Next
day they assembled and voted that the temple which Camillus had
vowed to Concord should, on account of this great event, be built
upon a spot viewing from a height the Forum and place of assembly"
(Plutarch, in "Camillus"). Ovid, speaking of the same temple
("Fasti," i. 640), says: "Fair Concord, the succeeding day places
thee in a snow-white shrine, near where elevated Moneta raises her
steps on high: now with ease wilt thou look down upon the Latin
crowd. Now have the august hands of Cæsar restored thee,"&mdash;referring
to its rebuilding by Tiberius, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 11. From both these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
authors we learn that it had a commanding prospect, and Ovid adds
that it was near the Temple of Moneta, which was likewise founded
by Camillus, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 411, as we learn from Livy (vii. 28, and vi. 20.
See Plutarch). "The site chosen was that spot in the Citadel where
the house of Manlius had stood." The site of the Temple of Concord
was on the Tarpeian Rock, at the top of the Centum Gradus, and
Camillus's Temple of Moneta was near it.</p>

<p>Livy (xxvi. 23) says: "In <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 542, at the Temple of Concord,
a statue of Victory, which stood on the summit of the roof, being
struck by lightning, and shaken at its base, fell and stuck among
the ensigns of the goddess which were on the pediment." This
temple, with a statue of Victory upon the summit, is represented
on a coin of Tiberius, who restored it.</p>

<p><i>Under the</i> wall, on our left, which supports the garden, some blocks
of tufa, <i>in situ</i>, are the remains of the Temple of Concord, and the wall
in the garden of the German Embassy is part of the Temple of Juno.</p>

<p><i>Passing down the street on our right, a left half-turn will bring
us to the old entrance of</i></p>

<h4>THE TABULARIUM.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Public Record Office.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Open every day from 10 till 3; fee, half lira.</i></p>

<p>We have now to speak of a building, the vast remains of which
impress us with the grandeur of the later republic. In the year of
the city 675 (<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 78) a building was erected against the Capitoline
Hill, and facing the Forum, to contain the public records, which
were engraved on bronze plates. Before that time they had been
kept in various temples.</p>

<p>"A decree was made by the senate that the records should be
kept in the Temple of Ceres with the public ædiles"&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 306&mdash;(Livy,
iii. 55).</p>

<p>"Treaties (such as between Pyrrhus and Rome) were then usual,
and the ædiles had them in their keeping in the Temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus, engraved on plates of copper" (Polybius, iii.).</p>

<p>That this was the usual way of keeping the records we learn from
the same author, who saw and copied those which "Hannibal left
at Lacinium&mdash;engraved tablets or records on copper of the events
of his stay in Italy."</p>

<p>"The censors went up immediately to the Temple of Liberty,
where they sealed the books of the public records, shut up the office,
and dismissed the clerks, affirming that they should do no kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
public business until the judgment of the people was passed on
them"&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 686&mdash;(Livy, xliii. 16).</p>

<p>We have no mention in classic history as to when this building
was erected, but fortunately an inscription has been handed down
to us, in which Quintus Lutatius Catulus (who dedicated the temple
to Jupiter Capitolinus) is expressly named, not only as the founder
of the Tabularium, but also of the substructions, the most difficult
portion of the whole, and which claim our fullest admiration.</p>

</div>

<p>The remains form the substructions of the present Capitol, or
senator's residence, consisting of a massive wall of Gabii stone
240 feet long and 37 feet high, supporting the portico on the side
of the Forum, which consisted of a series of arches, 23 feet by
15 feet, ornamented with sixteen Doric columns. Below this portico
or arcade are a series of small chambers, with windows looking into
the Forum, opening out of one another, approached by a short flight
of steps, and probably used to store the records. At the back of the
arcade are a series of large vaulted rooms or offices. At one end a
grand flight of steps (repaired) leads up into what has been a grand
arcade on the side of the Area Capitolina: its piers now partly
sustain the modern building. At the farther end of this arcade is
a flight of steep travertine steps, sixty-seven in number, leading
down into the Forum, the exit to which has been blocked up by the
Temple of Vespasian being built against the entrance.</p>

<p>This building must have presented a grand front to the Forum in
the olden time, though now it only sustains the buildings of Michael
Angelo. In 1389&ndash;1394, Pope Boniface IX. first erected on the Capitoline
Hill, on the ruins of the Tabularium, a residence for the
senator and his assessors. The prospect was altered so that what
was the front became the back, and it faced on to what was anciently
the Area Capitolina, now the Piazza del Campidoglio, instead of the
Forum.</p>

<p>The north side wall seems to have been cut down when the present
edifice was erected, as outside the present wall are the remains of the
ancient one; thus it was somewhat longer than we now see it. In
the sort of vestibule which gives admittance to the chambers under
the portico are remains of stairs, evidently leading up to some
chambers above the portico. These were probably not very lofty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
so that the view of the temples on the hill was not shut out from
the Forum, or perhaps they only led up to the flat roof above the
arcade.</p>

<p>These old remains have been used as a prison and as a salt store,
which latter has eaten the stone away in a curious manner. It is
now used as a museum of fragments. The arches of the portico
were filled in when the great master utilized it. Although we know
an arch is as strong as a wall, it is feared to open them, and one
only has been so treated.</p>

<p>Suetonius tells us: "Vespasian undertook to restore the three
thousand tablets of brass which had been destroyed in the fire which
consumed the Capitol; searching in all quarters for copies of those
curious and ancient records, in which were contained the decrees
of the senate almost from the building of the city, as well as the
acts of the people relative to alliances, treaties, and privileges
granted to any person" (Vespasian, viii.).</p>

<p>Pliny (xxxiv. 21) says: "It is upon tablets of brass that our
public enactments are engraved."</p>

<p><i>From the Tabularium a new iron stair leads up to</i></p>

<h4>THE TOWER OF THE CAPITOL,</h4>

<p>whence a fine view of Rome and its environs can be enjoyed, standing,
as it were, between ancient and medieval Rome. It is the best
position for study in the world.</p>

<p>From this height the huge mass of the Colosseum appears elegant
and light. The famous Seven Hills may be made out, notwithstanding
the alteration in the soil: on the left is the <span class="smcap">Quirinal</span>, beyond that
the <span class="smcap">Viminal</span>, and beyond that the <span class="smcap">Esquiline</span>; to the extreme right
is the <span class="smcap">Aventine</span>; before us is the <span class="smcap">Palatine</span>, with the <span class="smcap">C&oelig;lian</span>
beyond it; whilst we occupy the <span class="smcap">Capitoline</span>. The contemplation of
the city, however, produces the effect of a vast and solid reading of
history. Each of the great representations of the city, always and
differently mistress of the world, seems to have chosen its respective
quarter&mdash;the Rome of the kings and emperors is spread out on the
Palatine, Esquiline, and Quirinal; republican Rome occupies the
Capitol and Aventine; whilst Christian Rome, isolated and solitary,
reigns on the C&oelig;lian and Vatican eminences.</p>

<h4>THE SEVEN HILLS OF ROME.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Palatine</span>, which has ever had the preference, whether so-called
from the people Palantes, or Palatini, or from the bleating and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
strolling of cattle, in Latin, <i>balare</i> and <i>palare</i>, or from Pales, the
pastoral goddess, or from the burying-place of Pallas, is disputed
amongst authors. It was on this hill that Romulus, according to
popular tradition, laid the foundations of the city, in a quadrangular
form. Here Romulus and Tullus Hostilius kept their courts, as did
afterwards Augustus, and all the succeeding emperors, on which
account the word Palatium came to signify a royal seat (Rosin,
"Antiq." i. 4).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Aventine</span> derives its name from Aventinus, an Alban king
(Varro, "De Ling. Lat." iv.), or from the river Avens (<i>ibid.</i>), or from
Avibus, from the birds which used to fly thither in great flocks
from the Tiber (<i>ibid.</i>). It was also called Murcius, from Murcia, the
goddess of sleep, who had a temple here (Sextus Pompeius, Festus).
Also Collis Dianæ, from the Temple of Diana (Martial). Likewise
Remonius, from Remus, who wished the city to be commenced here,
and who was buried here (Plutarch, in "Romulus"). This hill was
added by Ancus Martius ("Eutropius," i.).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Capitoline</span>, formerly Saturn, then Tarpeian, took its name
from Tarpeia, a Roman virgin, who betrayed the city to the Sabines
at this point (Plutarch, in "Romulus"). It was also called Mons
Saturni and Saturnius, in honour of Saturn, who is reported to have
lived here, and was the titular deity of this part of the city. It was
afterwards called Capitoline, from the head of a man found here
when digging the foundations of the famous Temple of Jupiter. It
was added to the city when the Sabines were permitted by Romulus
to incorporate themselves with the Romans (Dionysius).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Quirinal</span> was either so called from the Temple of Quirinus,
another name of Romulus, or from the Curetes, a people that removed
hither with Tatius from Cures, a Sabine city (Sextus Pompeius,
Festus). It afterwards changed its name to Caballus, from two
marble horses, each having a man holding it, which are still standing,
and were the works of Phidias and Praxiteles ("Fabricii Roma,"
iii.), made to represent Alexander the Great and Bucephalus, and
presented to Nero by Tiridates, king of Armenia. Numa added this
hill to the city (Dionysius, ii.).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Esquiline</span> was anciently called Cispius and Oppius ("Fabricii
Roma," 3). The name Esquilinus was varied for the easier pronunciation
from Exquilinus, a corruption of Excubinus, ab Excubiis,
from the watch that Romulus kept there ("Propert." ii. 8). It was
taken in by Servius Tullius, who had his palace here (Livy, i. 44).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Viminal</span> derives its name from Vimina, signifying osiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
which grew here in large quantities. This hill was added by Servius
Tullius (Dionysius, iv.).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">C&oelig;lian</span> owes its name to C&oelig;lius or C&oelig;les, a famous Tuscan
general, who encamped here when he came to assist the Romans
against the Sabines (Varro, "De Ling. Lat." iv.). The other names
by which it was sometimes known were Querculanus or Querquetulanus,
and Augustus: the first, on account of its growth of oaks; and
the second, because the Emperor Tiberius built on it after a fire (Tacit.
"Ann." iv.; Suet. in "Tib." xlviii.). One part was called C&oelig;liolus,
and Minor C&oelig;liolus ("Fabricii Roma," 3). Livy (i. 30) and Dionysius
(iii.) attribute the taking of it into the city to Tullus Hostilius,
but Strabo ("Georg." v.) to Ancus Martius.</p>

<p>Whilst on the subject of the hills of Rome, three others are equally
famous.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Janiculum</span>, or Janicularis, so called either from an old town
of the same name, said to have been built by Janus, or because
Janus dwelt and was buried here (Ovid, "F." i. 246), or because it
was a <i>janua</i>, a sort of gate to the Romans, whence they issued out
upon the Tuscans (Festus). Its yellow sand gave it the name of
Mons Aureus, corrupted into Montorius ("Fabricii Roma," i. 3).
From an epigram of Martial, we may observe that it is the fittest
place to take one's standing for a full prospect of the city (Martial,
"Epig." iv. 64). It is famous for the sepulchres of Numa and Statius
the poet ("Fabricii Roma," i. 3), and in more recent times as the
grave of Tasso, and the spot where tradition holds that S. Peter was
executed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Vatican</span> owes its name to the <i>vates</i>, or prophets, who used
to give their answers here, or from the god Vaticanus or Vagitanus
(Festus). Formerly celebrated for the Gardens and Circus of Nero,
the scene of the Christian martyrdoms, and in our time for S. Peter's
and the Vatican. It was enclosed in the time of Aurelian, but was
considered as very unhealthy (Tacitus, "H." ii. 93).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pincio</span> (Collis Hortulorum, or Hortorum) took its name from
the gardens of Sallust adjoining it (Rosin, i. 2). It was afterwards
called Pincius, from the Pincii, a noble family who had their seat
here (<i>ibid.</i>). Aurelian first enclosed it (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p>The Capitol tower is crowned by a statue of Roma; and the great
bell formerly announced, by a strange contrast, the death of the
Pope and the opening of the Carnival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixth Room.</span>&mdash;On the wall of this room are preserved the Fasti
Consulares, dating from <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 481 to the end of the Republic. These
fragments were found in the Forum, and faced the podium of the

all noted in Italian history. At the end is a monument to Canova.</p>

<p><i>A door on the right opens into the</i></p>

<h5>FIRST HALL OF BRONZES.</h5>

<p class="center">(<i>For numbers, see plan.</i>)</p>

<p>1, 2. Cases of small bronze articles found at various times. 3. A
bronze biga, or two-horse chariot, with reliefs depicting scenes from
the circus; restored upon a wooden frame, and given by Signor A.
Castellani. 4. A bisellium, or chair of state. 8. Lectica, or sedan
chair. "These infirmities caused him [Claudius] to be carried in
a close chair, which no Roman had ever used before; and from
thence have the emperors and the rest of us consular men taken the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
custom of using chairs of that sort, for neither Augustus nor Tiberius
used anything but small litters, which are still in fashion for the
women" (Dion Cassius). 9, 10. Shelves containing household utensils,
&amp;c. 11. Fragments of columns of Bigio marble.</p>

<h5>ROOM OF COINS.</h5>

<p>The beautiful alabaster pavement of this room was found, as now
fixed, upon the Esquiline Hill, on Christmas eve, 1874. It formed
part of the House of the Larmæ, where the statues were found. The
coins formed part of the Campana Collection, and are of great value.
The small case of gems is worth looking into; it contains some fragments
not unlike the Portland vase, white reliefs on a blue ground.</p>

<p><i>We now enter the new</i></p>

<h5>OCTAGONAL HALL.</h5>

<p class="center">(<i>The order is liable to alteration, as objects are constantly being added.</i>)</p>

<p>This museum is formed of the remains found in the excavations of
the municipality since Rome was made the capital of united Italy.
The new circular hall, designed by Signor Vespignani, presents a
light and elegant effect. Amongst the most important subjects placed
in the new hall, we may mention No. 2, the monument of Quintus
Sulpicius Maximus, found in 1870 in the Old Porta Salaria. The
inscription states that he died at the early age of thirteen years, five
months, and twelve days. He carried off the honours for composing
Greek verse against fifty-two competitors. The poem is engraved on
the pilasters. The subject is&mdash;The arguments used by Jove in reproving
Ph&oelig;bus for intrusting his chariot to Phaeton. Africa's
deserts and the negroes' black skins are ascribed to the careless
driving of Phaeton on that occasion. No. 5. Venus. 23. Mercury.
11. A bust of Faustina the elder. 13. A youth anointing himself.
14 and 16. Tritons. 15. A half statue of the Emperor Commodus
as Hercules, beautifully executed in fine marble, with the lion's skin
over his head and knotted upon his chest: in his right hand is the
club. A bracket of marble, ornamented at its end with a celestial
globe, rested on the pedestal, which formed a shield, a band running
round the centre with the signs of the zodiac. This bracket is supported
by two kneeling figures, holding cornucopias containing fruit.
One is in good preservation; the fragments of the other were also
found. 17. Plotina, wife of Trajan. 18. Apollo. 19. Bacchus,
with a satyr on a leopard at his side. 21. Sarcophagus of the Calydonian
boar hunt. Polyhymnia. 24. Terpsichore. 26. A beautiful
nude statue of a young girl or nymph leaving the bath, of Parian
marble, standing with sandalled feet by a pedestal, which supports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
her robe, the left hand fastening up the hair. 28, 29. Two magistrates
about to start the racers by dropping a handkerchief. They
represent L. A. A. Symmachus, prefect of Rome, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 365, and his
son; and are unique. The father was found in one hundred and
eighty pieces, and the son in ninety pieces, which have been carefully
put together. 31. Colossal statue. 33. Fortune. Apollo with the Lyre.
Relief, forging the Shield of Minerva. 38, 42. Athletes starting for the
Race. 40<i>a</i>. A Cow. 44. Manlia Scantilla. Marsyas bound to the
tree; the finest statue in the collection, found in 1879. 48. Didia Clara.
49<i>a</i>. A Roman General; a striking statue. 8. The Earth; a sitting
statuette in a niche found in the Roman Cemetery. 9. A Baccante.</p>

<p><i>In the inner circle.</i>&mdash;A magnificent marble vase, found upon the
Esquiline, called by the Greeks a Rhyton: it is the work of Pontios,
an Athenian sculptor. A vase with figures in relief. The infant
Hercules found at the Cemetery of S. Lorenzo. Another vase. The
Muse of Astronomy. <i>Exit.</i> 74, 75. Hercules taming the Horses:
part of a group found in many fragments, and very skilfully put together.
Seated statue of a girl. 133. Minerva. 130. A statue of
Silenus, which was formerly a fountain. A youth carrying a pig for
sacrifice. Cupid playing with a tortoise. 123. Boy with a puppy.
81. Statuette of Venus. 81<i>a</i>. A Sleeping Cupid. 124. A large stone
shield sculptured with the acanthus leaf. 90. Mithras slaying the
Bull. 117, 105, 106. Reliefs relating to the worship of the Persian
sun-god Mithras, recently found on the Esquiline Hill.</p>

<p><i>Crossing the Hall of Busts, by Canova's Monument, we enter the</i></p>

<h5>TERRA-COTTA ROOM,</h5>

<p>composed of remains found chiefly in the excavations in building the
new quarter of Rome upon the Esquiline Hill. <i>The principal objects
are</i>:&mdash;A coffin containing skulls; a large jar containing a leaden case, in
which is enclosed a beautiful alabaster urn; a large and varied collection
of Roman lamps, glass, and terra-cotta; also glass in various forms,
and for windows, pieces of fresco, &amp;c. <i>A door on the left leads into the</i></p>

<h5>SECOND HALL OF BRONZES.</h5>

<p>In the centre of the first room is the celebrated bronze wolf of the
Capitol (1), thus alluded to by Virgil ("Æn." viii. 630):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"By the wolf were laid the martial twins,</p>
<p>Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung:</p>
<p>The foster-dam lolled out her fawning tongue:</p>
<p>They sucked secure, while, bending back her head,</p>
<p>She licked their tender limbs, and formed them as they fed."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>Cicero (in "Catiline" iii. 8), mentions this object as a small gilt figure
of Romulus sucking the teat of a wolf, which was struck by lightning,
and which his hearers remembered to have seen in the Capitol.</p>

<p>Dionysius, quoting from an older historian, Quintus Fabius Pictor,
speaks of a temple in which a statue is placed representing the above
incident. It is a wolf suckling two children; they are in brass, and
of ancient workmanship. This latter must not be confounded with
the statue mentioned by Cicero, which is generally believed to be the
one before us. The fracture on the hind leg may have been caused
by lightning, and traces of gilt may still be observed. It is not
known where it was found, but in Cicero's time (<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 106&ndash;43) it was
to be "seen in the Capitol." The workmanship of the wolf is of an
early period, Etruscan; the twins are Roman.</p>

<p>10. A bull, found in Trastevere in 1849. 4. "Thou seest the
faces of Hecate turned in three directions, that she may watch the
cross-roads cut into three pathways." She was the patroness of
magic, and was also set up before houses to ward off evil. This
goddess is often confounded with Diana. 8. The shepherd Martius,
a bronze statue of a boy extracting a thorn from his foot. 14. Horse
found in Trastevere. 13. Foot found near the Colosseum.</p>

<p>The case on the left contains, amongst other objects, a bronze inscription,
with heads in alto-relief, of Septimius Severus, Caracalla,
and Julia Pia. 9. Gilt bronze statue of Hercules, found amongst
the remains of a temple of Hercules, behind the Church of S. Maria
in Cosmedin. 2, 3. Bronze globes, one of which was held in the hand
of Trajan's statue on his column. 15. Diana of the Ephesians in bronze
and marble. 6. A Camillus, one of the twelve youths who assisted
at the sacrifices. 7. Bust of Lucius Junius Brutus, who expelled the
Tarquins. 5. A fluted vase, found in the sea at Porto d'Anzio; a gift
of Mithridates, King of Pontus, to a gymnasium of the Eupatorists.</p>

<p><i>From the Hall of Bronzes we enter the</i></p>

<h5>ITALO-GRECO AND ETRUSCAN MUSEUM.</h5>

<p>Formed by Signor A. Castellani, and presented by him to the senate
and people of Rome. The objects were mostly found at Cervetri,
Tarquinii, and Veii.</p>

<p><i>Passing out into the Hall of Busts, a door on the right leads to the</i></p>

<h5>PINACOTHECA, OR PICTURE GALLERY.</h5>

<p><i>Open every day from 10 till 3.</i></p>

<p>Founded by Benedict XIV., and composed of several rooms. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
following are the most celebrated pictures, but each picture has the
names of the artist and the subject printed under the frame:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room.</span>&mdash;<i>Right</i>: Romulus and Remus, by Rubens; Holy
Family, by Giorgione; S. Cecilia, by Romanelli; Baptism, by Guercino;
Magdalen, by Guido; Cumæan Sibyl, by Domenichino; Persian
Sibyl, by Guercino; Madonna, by Botticelli; Assumption, by Cola
dell'Amatrice; The Redeemed Spirit, by Guido; Madonna, by Francia.</p>

<p>The frescoes on the walls are from the deserted palace Magliana,
the hunting-seat of Leo X., which has long been utilized as a farm
by a community of nuns, and only inhabited by labourers. The frescoes
are all more or less injured, and the feet of each figure, together
with the lower part of the pictures, are quite obliterated. They represent
the Muses, with Apollo as Musagetes, each figure distinguished
by a motto in verse descriptive of the individual character,
from the epigrams of Ausonius, and consist of the figures of Polyhymnia;
Urania, with a distant view of Florence in the background
(perhaps allusive to the pre-eminence of that city in astronomical
science); Thalia, with the motto, "Comica lasciva gaudet sermone
Thalia;" Clio, who is playing on the double flute; and Apollo, as
leader of the Nine, who is seated, and playing on the violin: in the
background of this picture is introduced a small group of Perseus
slaying Medusa, while Pegasus springs from the blood of the decapitated
gorgon. All these frescoes are ascribed to Giovanni lo Spagna,
and there is much in their conception and sentiment which reminds
us of the far superior works by that pupil of Pietro Perugino.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Corridor</span> contains views of Rome by Vanvitelli.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;Annunciation, by Garofalo; Madonna, by P.
Veronese. Portraits by Vandyck, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Room.</span>&mdash;Baptism, by Titian; Sebastian, by Bellini; S. Barbara,
by Domenichino; Innocence, by Romanelli.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Room.</span>&mdash;<i>Left</i>: S. Lucia, by Spagna; Europa, by P. Veronese;
Burial and Assumption of Petronella, by Guercino; Sebastian,
by Caracci; Cleopatra and Augustus, by Guercino; Sebastian, by
Guido; Baptism, by Tintoretto.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the Palazzo dei Conservatori, and crossing the Piazza, we

<h5>HALL OF MOSAICS.</h5>

<p class="center">(<i>Left-hand end of Corridor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room.</span>&mdash;In the centre is a vase of black basalt sculptured in
relief after the Egyptian style. Along the right wall are three panels
of peperino stone representing two dogs and a stag in an archaic style.</p>

<p>Several mosaics have been recently placed here, found in the
recent excavations:&mdash;A standing male figure spinning. Hercules
conquered by Love, represented in Cupids playing with a bound lion.
A group of figures and fragments from the house of Avidius Quietus,
found in making the new Via Nazionale, notably a galley with sails
set and colours flying approaching a port which is well represented
with its lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;The walls are covered with inscriptions, and round
the room are sarcophagi, cippi, bases, and urns. Amongst others a
beautiful alabaster cinerary urn (5), which stands on a base inscribed
to Fabius Cilone, prefect of Rome under Septimius Severus, who had
performed the annual sacrifice to Hercules at the Ara Maxima, at
the entrance to the Circus Maximus. 7. Base to Faustina, found
near the Temple of Saturn. 9. Base erected by Nobilior, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 189, to

the king's son. This sarcophagus was found on the Via Appia. 4.
Sarcophagus representing deer and boar hunts, found on Via Appia.
9. Circular base with inscription to the prefect Catius Sabinus, who
had performed the sacrifice to Hercules: interesting, with the one
in the other room, as showing that the rite instituted by Evander
was kept up till a late period. To the right of the door is the fragment
recording the cancelling of the debts of the people throughout
Italy in 118 by Hadrian. Near by is one to Aulus Septicius Alexander,
a seller of floral wreaths on the Sacred Way. At the end of
the room an inscription to S. Severus, 196. It was used by the city
Conservatori in 1676 (see rear) to record their privileges. Placed
here in 1886.</p>

<h5>HALL OF INSCRIPTIONS.</h5>

<p class="center">(<i>Right-hand end of Corridor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room.</span>&mdash;1. Square altar representing the labours of Hercules;
also busts of no importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;3, 4, 6, 11. Monumental cippi, with working tools
in bas-relief; likewise the same emblems on 10, fragment of a column.
6. Inscription to Marcus Æbutius. 4. Lapis Capponianus. 3.
Cossutius. 11. T. Statilius Aper, and to his wife Orcivia Antides;
found on the Janiculum. He was a surveyor; the verse stating that
he died at the age of twenty-two years, eight months, and fifteen days.</p>

<p>5. Sarcophagus found on the Via Appia, representing a fight
between Roman and Gallic cavalry, when, in 223 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, Marcus Marcellus
killed Virdomarus, the chief of the Insubrian Gauls, and so
carried off the third Spolia Opima (Livy, "Ep." xx.; Florus, ii. 4;
Eutropius, iii. 6; Plutarch, in "Marcellus"). The central figure is
strikingly like the figure of the wounded Gaul miscalled the dying
gladiator.</p>

<p>12. Inscription to Vettius Agorius Prætextatus, prefect 367, and
his wife, Paolina. 14. Bust of Crispina, wife of Commodus. 13.
Inscription from villa of Herodes Atticus, Via Appia, used afterwards
as a milestone under Maxentius.</p>

<p>2. Monument to Bathyllus, an actor of the time of Augustus, afterwards
custodian of the Temple of the Deified Augustus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Room.</span>&mdash;1. Sarcophagus found in a mound on the road to
Frascati, called Monte del Grano. Inside the sarcophagus was found
the Portland vase now in the British Museum, which contained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
ashes. The sarcophagus is surmounted by the figures of a man and
woman in repose. The reliefs illustrate the life of Achilles. 2. Relief
of Priests of Cybele. 6. Cosimati mosaic, with reliefs from life of
Achilles. 12, 13. Portraits in relief of Nero and Poppæa. 15. Pluto
and Cerberus, found in the Baths of Titus, 1812.</p>

<h5>STAIRCASE.</h5>

<p>On the walls are encased the fragments of the marble plan of Rome
found in 1534&ndash;50, 1867, behind the Church of SS. Cosmo and Damiano.
They had originally served for the panelling of the wall that formed
part of the Temple of Rome built by Hadrian. The plan was made
in the third century, in the time of the Emperor Septimius Severus
(193&ndash;211). It is called the "Pianta Capitolina," and is of great use
to archæologists in studying the ground plan of the different buildings
marked upon it, though not as showing their relative positions.</p>

<p>After many years of study we have succeeded in putting this puzzle
together, and have published the marble plan, systematically arranged
in ten sheets, price six shillings, with descriptive letterpress.</p>

<p><i>The doors at the top of the stairs lead us into the</i></p>

<h5>HALL OF THE DYING GAUL.</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"He leans upon his hand; his manly brow</p>
<p>Consents to death, but conquers agony;</p>
<p>And his drooped head sinks gradually low;</p>
<p>And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow</p>
<p>From the red gash, fall heavily one by one."</p>
</div></div>

<p>This perfect statue of "a wounded man dying, who perfectly expressed
how much life was remaining in him," has for many years
been miscalled "The Dying Gladiator;" but it has of late years been
more correctly described as a wounded Gaul. It was found, together
with the Gallic group in the Ludovisi Villa, amongst the ruins of the
gardens of Sallust, and with that formed part of a large group representing
the death of Aner&oelig;stus, the Gallic chief, who with other
leaders killed themselves after their defeat by the Romans in 226 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>,
near Orbitello&mdash;Attilius, the Roman consul, having been previously
killed in the fight (Polybius, ii. 2). 7. Lycian Apollo, found near the
Aquæ Albulæ on the road to Tivoli. 6. Female carrying a vase,
standing on an altar dedicated to Hercules by C. Ulpius Fronto, <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
126; found in the Forum Boarium. 5. Bust of Bacchus. 4. Amazon,
the finest of its class in existence. 3. Alexander, by Lysippus. 2.
Juno. 16. Bust of <i>Et tu, Brute</i>. 15. Isis. 14. Flora (?), found at
Hadrian's Villa, thought to be Sabina, the wife of Hadrian. 12.

Antinoüs, found at Hadrian's Villa. 10. The Faun of Praxiteles,
found at Civita Lavinia, amongst the ruins of the Villa of Antoninus
Pius. This is the Marble Faun of Hawthorne. 9. Girl protecting
a dove. 8. Zeno, the Stoic philosopher.</p>

<h5>HALL OF THE FAUN.</h5>

<p>1. The celebrated and beautiful faun in rosso-antico, found at
Hadrian's Villa, Tivoli. 5. Tydeus, the father of Diomedes&mdash;a hollow
mask. 3. The Endymion sarcophagus, found under the high altar
of the Church of S. Eustacio; the cover belongs to another sarcophagus.
8. Boy with a scenic mask. 16. Boy with a goose, found
near S. John's Lateran. 18. Sarcophagus representing the battle
between Amazons and Athenians. On the wall above is the bronze
table on which is engraved a portion of the Lex Regia conferring the
imperial power on Vespasian, and from which Rienzi demonstrated
to the people their political rights. It was discovered near the
Lateran about 1300, and was kept in the Basilica.</p>

<h5>HALL OF THE CENTAURS.</h5>

<p>1. Jupiter, in black marble. 2, 4. Cloud-born Centaurs, found at
Hadrian's Villa, the joint work of Aristeas and Papias, sculptors of
Aphrodisium, in bigio-morato marble. Pliny says he saw a Centaur
that had been embalmed in honey, which had been brought from
Egypt to Rome in the time of Claudius. 3. The infant Hercules, in
green basalt, found on the Aventine. 5. Æsculapius, in black marble.

columns of Porta Santa. 17. Minerva, an archaic statue, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 450.
21. A teacher imparting instruction, found in Hadrian's Villa. 22.
Præfica: a hired mourner at funerals; a tear-bottle will be noticed
in her hand. 28. Harpocrates, found at Hadrian's Villa. 27. A

<p>The walls are adorned with bas-reliefs. The seated figure in the
centre of the room is supposed to be Marcus Claudius Marcellus,
the great general of the republic, who died <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 208.</p>

<p>There are several bas-reliefs round the room. Seated in the centre
is Agrippina, "the glory of the Roman matrons;" daughter of M.
V. Agrippa and Julia, daughter of Augustus; wife of Germanicus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
and mother of Caligula. "It is a statue combining an expression of
moral dignity and of intellectual force, with as much beauty and poetical
grace as the genius of sculpture ever borrowed from breathing nature
to work out its own miracles of art. This statue&mdash;a history and an
epic in itself&mdash;represents a woman in the prime of life seated in a
chair of state, and in the deep repose of meditative thought. The
statue is lofty, her brow of high capacity, her mouth expressive of
love and wit, and all her features are harmonized by that regularity
which is ever denied to defective organizations. Over the whole of
this simply-draped and noble figure there is an air of tranquil
majesty, which, in its solemn influence, likens it to the statues of the
gods" (Lady Morgan). It may have originally stood on the cinerary
base in the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori.</p>

<h5>UPPER CORRIDOR.</h5>

<p><i>In our order of visiting the Museum the subjects in this Corridor commence
at the highest number.</i></p>

<p>Vase of white marble, found near the tomb of Cecilia Metella;
it is decorated with vine leaves and fruit. The pedestal is a very
interesting Grecian marble well head; on it are the twelve principal
deities. 29. Minerva. 28. Bust of Marcus Aurelius. 25. Jupiter
standing on the altar of Cybele, dedicated in memory of Claudia
drawing the galley up to Rome, which is shown in relief. <i>Entrance
to Cabinet of Venus.</i> 20. Psyche. 46. Sarcophagus illustrating the
birth of Bacchus. 47. Jupiter. 49. Juno. 30. Gladiator restored
from a Discobolus. 52. Euterpe. 10. Cinerary urn. 54. Sarcophagus
representing the Rape of Proserpine. 54<i>a.</i> Infant Hercules strangling
a serpent. 56. Female statue. 8. Drunken Baccante. <i>Entrance
to Hall of Doves.</i> 5. Cupid. 3. A lion. 63. Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<h5>CABINET OF VENUS.</h5>

<p>The celebrated Venus of the Capitol, found in a walled-up chamber
on the Viminal, is rather the statue of a beautiful woman in full
maturity than of Venus as a goddess. Cupid and Psyche, found on
the Aventine&mdash;a beautiful little group. Leda and the Swan.</p>

<h5>HALL OF THE DOVES.</h5>

<p>So called from the beautiful mosaic set <i>in the wall on the right in
entering</i>, mentioned by Pliny as the work of Sosus existing at Pergamos,&mdash;"There
is a dove greatly admired in the act of drinking,
and throwing the shadow of its head upon the water, while other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
birds are to be seen sunning and pluming themselves on the margin
of a drinking bowl." It was found in Hadrian's Villa. Beyond is
also a mosaic representing two scenic masks, found on the Aventine.
In the windows are glass cases containing styli, coins, and lamps.
83. Fixed on the side of the farther window, the Iliac Table representing
the Fall of Troy as described by Virgil; to each group is attached
an explanatory inscription in Greek: found at Bovillæ. 49.
Diana of Ephesus. 37. Sarcophagus of Gerontia, representing the fable
of Endymion. 13. The Prometheus sarcophagus. On shelves round the
room are placed numerous busts, but these are not of much interest.</p>

<p><i>On coming out of the Museum</i> cross the square and turn to the left,
by the side of the Tabularium (note the paving-stones at the end of
the Sacra Via), then turn to the right, Via Monte Tarpeia, proceed
along this street, and keep straight on down the steps.</p>

<h4>THE TRAITORS' LEAP.</h4>

<p>By descending the <i>Centum Gradus</i>, and turning to the left, we see
the rock, within the space closed off by the rails. The house on the
top will roughly represent the original height of the rock. If we
then add forty feet to the depth, we shall have some idea of the
traitors' leap, which cured all ambition.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF OPS.</h4>

<p>The municipal authorities have lately pulled down a house on the
Vicus Jugarius which obstructed the view of the far end of the Tarpeian
Rock from the Forum. We use the title Tarpeian Rock as applied
to the place of execution and not to the whole hill. They have
exposed to view not only the rock, but likewise one side of the Temple
of Ops, composed of large blocks of tufa stone surmounted by later
brick structures. The earliest mention we have of this temple is in
<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 183, when Livy says (xxxix. 22): "By order of the pontiffs a supplication,
of one day's continuance, was added on account of the Temple
of Ops, near the Capitol, having been struck by lightning." This
temple is also mentioned by Cicero, from whom we learn that it was
where the clerks kept the accounts of the treasury: "Would that the
money remained in the Temple of Ops! Bloodstained, indeed, it may
be, but still needful at these times, since it is not restored to those to
whom it really belongs" (First "Philippic," 7). "Who delivered
yourself from an enormous burden of debt at the Temple of Ops;
who, by your dealings with the account-books there, squandered a
countless sum of money" (Second, 14). "Where are the seven hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
millions of sesterces which were entered in the account-books
which are in the Temple of Ops? A sum lamentable indeed as to the
means by which it was procured, but still one which, if it were not
restored to those to whom it belonged, might save us from taxes"
(Second, 37). "And that accounts of the money in the Temple of Ops
are not to be meddled with. That is to say, that those seven hundred
millions of sesterces are not to be recovered from him; that the Septemviri
are to be exempt from blame or from prosecution for what
they have done" (Eighth, 9).</p>

<p>Ops was the daughter of C&oelig;lus and Terra, and the wife of Saturn;
hence her connection with the treasury. The temple was turned into
a church, and called S. Salvatore in Ærario, or in Statera (the Saviour
in the Treasury), which lapsed into S. Maria in Portico. It has now
become a fruit shop; and a small fresco of the Crucifixion, very much
obliterated, marks its former use. The west wall of the temple has
been exposed in the recent changes, and part of the eastern wall can
be seen by entering the court-yard by the flight of steps through the
wall, No. 57, opposite the end of S. Maria di Consolazione.</p>

<p><i>The Via Consolazione and the Via Montanara to the right bring us to</i></p>

<h4>THE THEATRE OF MARCELLUS.</h4>

<p>The design of erecting a stone theatre in this quarter had been
entertained by Julius Cæsar (Suetonius, "Cæsar," xliv.), but the
carrying out of his adopted father's plan was reserved for Augustus
(<i>ibid.</i>, "Aug." xxix.). He did not, however, appropriate the honour
of so great a work to himself, but transferred it to his beloved son-in-law,
Marcellus. Great part of the outer walls of this large and
splendid building still exists. Against these leaned the arches, supporting
the tier of seats destined for the spectators. The greater
portion of the vast halls have also been preserved; but being now
converted into offices belonging to the Palace of the Orsini, which has
insinuated itself into these ruins, they are not accessible to strangers.
The lower story is in the Doric, the second in the Ionic, and the third
was probably in the Corinthian order. It held 20,000 people.</p>

<h4>THE DECEMVIRAL PRISONS.</h4>

<p>Built by Appius Claudius for common offenders, <i>near</i> the Forum Olitorium,
and which site was afterwards occupied by the Theatre of Marcellus
(Pliny, vii. 37). We have identified this prison, remains of which
can still be seen under the theatre, consisting of chambers constructed
in <i>opus reticulatum</i>. There are two splendid open archways of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
same material leading into two large chambers, in the vaults of which
are holes for letting the prisoners down. This we believe to have
been the Decemviral Prisons and the scene of <i>Caritas Romana</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Here youth offered to old age the food,</p>
<p class="i1">The milk of his own gift."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Byron visited the chambers under S. Nicola in Carcere, when he was
moved to compose his beautiful lines. He had before him the
scene, though not the site; his words are more applicable to these
dungeons, and we may say with him,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>There is a dungeon, in whose dim, drear light</p>
<p class="i1">What do I gaze on?&mdash;Nothing."</p>
</div></div>
<p><i>Passing the Theatre, a narrow lane on the left leads to the remains of</i></p>

<h4>THE PORTICO OF OCTAVIA.</h4>

<p>Dedicated to Octavia by her brother Augustus (Suetonius, "Aug."
xxix.). The principal portion still existing belonged to the great
portal leading to the open space surrounded by corridors which gave
the people shelter during rain. In this stood two temples, the
one dedicated to Jupiter, the other to Juno. Pillars belonging to
the latter may be seen in a house in the Via Pescheria, and remains
of the Portico of Octavia at No. 12 Via Teatro di Marcello. The inscription
on the architrave states that the building was restored by
Septimius Severus and Caracalla.</p>

<p>On the removal of two of the columns on which the pediment
rested, their place was supplied by an arch of brickwork, thus preventing
the building from falling in.</p>

<p>Four columns and two piers are still standing of the inner row; of
the outside only two columns remain, in addition to the two piers.
The capitals are ornamented with eagles bearing thunderbolts. A
flight of steps led up to this vestibule.</p>

<p>The stumps of columns built into the walls of several houses in the
vicinity in all probability belonged to the same edifice, which must
originally have presented a most magnificent appearance.</p>

<p>The Portico was ornamented with many statues; and besides
the two temples, there were libraries. It was originally erected by
Metellus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 146 (Paterculus, i. 11). The temples were built by Mr.
Lizard and Mr. Frog; but the senate would not allow them to put
their names on the buildings, and so to hand down their work they
sculptured on the spirals of the columns lizards and frogs (Pliny,
xxxvi. 4). This can still be seen in the Church of S. Lorenzo on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
road to Tivoli, the columns being taken there from here. The same
authority (xxxiv. 15) gives particulars of the many statues; and
amongst others one to Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, the base
of which was found here in 1878, and is now in the courtyard of the
new Museum of the Capitol. Pliny also tells us that when they
dedicated the temples they by mistake carried the god into the
goddess's temple, and so they let them remain as the will of the gods.</p>

<p><i>On the right</i> is the <span class="smcap">Church of S. Angelo in Pescheria</span>. Here
Rienzi, on May 20, 1347, held his meeting for the re-establishment of
"the good estate;" and here he exhibited his allegorical picture, and
thence marched to the Church of S. George to fix up the proclamation.</p>

<p><i>From the right-hand corner of this square a little alley leads to the
Via Rua, the principal street of</i></p>

<h4>THE GHETTO,</h4>

<p>or Jews' Quarter. The word "Ghetto" comes from the Hebrew word <i>chat</i>,
broken or dispersed. The Jews first settled here in the time of Pompey
the Great; but it was not till 1556 that the Ghetto was enclosed by
Pope Paul IV. putting gates across the streets. The Jews were not
allowed to be out after sunset or before sunrise, and he compelled the
men to wear yellow hats and the women yellow veils. The old inhabitants,
who were not Jews, were turned out, and obliged to give up
their houses to the Jews on perpetual copy-hold leases, which are handed
down in the families to the present day. Pius IX. abolished the gates,
but it was not till the Italian troops entered Rome that the Jews obtained
full liberty like their fellow-citizens. The lower part of the
houses in the Ghetto are of Roman construction, and there is very little
accumulation of soil there. There are about four thousand Jews in
Rome, and notwithstanding the closeness with which they are packed
and the dirt in which they live, the district is entirely free from fever.</p>

<p><i>Proceeding along</i> the Via Rua, we enter the Piazza di S. Maria
del Pianto, the Square of Tears. On the right are several old Roman
houses, with the upper part rebuilt, and the following medieval
inscription, put up in the two thousand two hundred and twenty-first
year of Rome, recording that here was the Forum Judæorum:&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE CENCI PALACE,</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Palazzo Cenci</i>,)</p>

<p>the scene of the persecution of Beatrice, which led to her execution
through the murder of her father at Petrella.</p>

<p>"The story is, that an old man having spent his life in debauchery
and wickedness, conceived at length an implacable hatred towards his
children, which showed itself towards one daughter under the form of
an incestuous passion, aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and
violence. This daughter, after long and vain attempts to escape from
what she considered a perpetual contamination both of body and
mind, at length plotted with her mother-in-law and brother to
murder their common tyrant" (Shelley).</p>

<p>"The Cenci Palace is of great extent; and though in part modernized,
there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture,
in the same state as during the dreadful scenes which are the subject
of this tragedy&mdash;'The Cenci.' The palace is situated in an obscure
corner of Rome, near the quarter of the Jews, and from the upper
windows you see the immense ruins of Mount Palatine, half hidden
beneath the profuse undergrowth of trees. There is a court in one
part of the palace (perhaps that in which Cenci built the chapel to
S. Thomas) supported by granite columns, and adorned with antique
friezes of fine workmanship, and built up, according to the ancient
Italian fashion, with balcony over balcony of open work. One of
the gates of the palace, formed of immense stones, and leading
through a passage dark and lofty, and opening into gloomy subterranean
chambers, struck me particularly" (Shelley).</p>

<p>From an old manuscript recently brought to light, and the reports
of the trial which have been recently published, the story of Beatrice
Cenci appears divested of the fiction of a historical novel; and
these papers prove her to have been anything but the innocent
victim she is represented in the romantic stories we have all read.</p>

<p><i>On the left of the Piazza</i> is the Jewish Synagogue, once a Christian
church, dedicated to S. Lorenzo in Damaso, and sold to the Jews
by Pope Sixtus V. when he was in need of money.</p>

<p>The Cenci Palace stands upon the substructions of</p>

<h4>THE THEATRE OF BALBUS.</h4>

<p>Erected <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 12, as a compliment to Augustus, by L. Cornelius
Balbus (Suetonius, "Aug." xxix.), being the third permanent theatre
erected in Rome. It held twelve thousand spectators. Pliny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
(xxxiv. 12) says: "Cornelius Balbus erected four small pillars of
onyx in his theatre as something marvellous." At No. 23 Via
Calderari, <i>to the right of the Cenci Palace</i>, some remains can be
seen of the <span class="smcap">Portico</span> of the Theatre of Balbus, which was two stories
high. Built into the house are two Doric columns of travertine
stone, supporting an architrave, which is interspersed with brickwork
repairs, by Septimius Severus, after a fire. Opposite are three
pilasters supporting a vault.</p>

<p>In the lane opposite, the Palace of the Cenci can best be seen; this
part has not been restored. <i>Passing under the archway</i>, on our left,
is the gateway spoken of by Shelley.</p>

<h4>THE THEATRE OF POMPEY.</h4>

<p>"Pompey also built that magnificent theatre, which is standing
at this day, at whose dedication five hundred lions were killed in five
days, and eighteen elephants having fought against armed men, part
of them died upon the place, and the rest soon after" (Dion Cassius,
"Cæsar"). Plutarch relates the same. The same author, in his
"Life of Nero," speaking of the reception of Tiridates, says: "There
was a great assembly in the Theatre of Pompey by order of the
senate. Not only the scene, but all the inside of the theatre, and
everybody that came into it, were covered with gold, which made
that day be named Golden Day. The covering which was spread over
it to defend the spectators from the heat of the sun, was of rich stuff,
the colour of purple, representing the heavens, in the midst of which
was Nero driving a chariot." (See Pliny, xxxiii. 16.) "Tiberius
undertook to restore the Theatre of Pompey" (Suetonius, "Tiberius,"
xlvii.). "Tiberius undertook to rebuild the Theatre of Pompey,
which was accidentally burned, because none of the family was equal
to the charge; still, however, to be called by the name of Pompey"
(Tacitus, "Ann." iii. 72). "Caligula completed it" (Suetonius,
"Caligula," xxi.). It was burned; and again rebuilt by Caracalla, as
we learn from an inscription found at Ostia in 1881. "In the games
which Claudius presented at the dedication of Pompey's theatre,
which had been burned down, and was rebuilt by him, he presided
upon a tribunal erected for him in the orchestra; having first paid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
his devotions in the temple above, and then coming down through
the centre of the circle, while all the people kept their seats in profound
silence" (Suetonius, "Claudius," xxi.). It accommodated
forty thousand (Pliny, xxxvi. 24). It was built <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 55, "in his
second consulship" (Vel. Paterculus, ii. 48); but afraid of the
criticism of the people, he erected at the top of the seats a temple to
Venus.</p>

<h4>THE SPOT WHERE CÆSAR FELL.</h4>

<p>In the neighbourhood of his theatre Pompey built a house for himself
(Plutarch); and from the back of the stage a portico (Vitruvius),
which, according to Propertius (ii. 32), must have been a beautiful
place.</p>

<p>"Pompey's portico, I suppose, with its shady columns, and magnificently
ornamented with purple curtains, palls upon you; and the
thickly-planted, even line of plane-trees, and the waters that fall from a
sleeping Maro, and in streams lightly bubbling all over." In the centre
of this portico Pompey erected a large hall, which he presented to the
Roman people for the use of the senate. At the time of Cæsar's
assassination the senate house on the Forum was being rebuilt.
Suetonius ("Cæsar," lxxx.), says: "Public notice had been given, by
proclamation, for the senate to assemble upon the ides of March
(15th) in the senate house built by Pompey: the conspirators
approved both time and place as most fitting for their purpose."
"They killed him in the hall of Pompey, giving him twenty-three
wounds" (Livy, "Ep." cxvi.). "The conspirators having surrounded
him in Pompey's senate house, fell upon him all together, and killed
him with several strokes" (Dion Cassius, "Cæsar." See Suetonius,
"Cæsar," lxxxii.).</p>

<p>"The place, too, where the senate was to meet seemed providentially
favourable for their purpose. It was a portico adjoining
the theatre; and in the midst of a saloon, furnished with benches,
stood a statue of Pompey, which had been erected to him by the
commonwealth when he adorned that part of the city with those
buildings. The senate being assembled, and Cæsar entering, the
conspirators got close about Cæsar's chair. Cassius turned his face
to Pompey's statue, and invoked it, as if it had been sensible of his
prayers" (Plutarch. See Florus, iv. 2).</p>

<p>"The senate house in which he was slain was ordered to be shut
up, and a decree was made that the ides of March should be called
parricidal, and that the senate should never more assemble on that
day" (Suetonius, "Cæsar," lxxxviii.).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p><i>After making the circuit of the seats of the theatre, the Via Chiavari
leads to the</i> <span class="smcap">Church of S. Andrea delle Valle</span>, built on the site
of Pompey's senate house.</p>

<p>On the marble plan of Rome, in the Capitoline Museum, a
fragment shows Pompey's theatre, portico, and senate house. With
the given remains of the theatre and the plan it is easy to find
the site of the Curia, which is shown on the plan in the form of a
basilica: this will bring the curve exactly at the apse of the Church
of S. Andrew. Now, we are told that Cæsar was seated in the chair
where in the morning Brutus dispensed justice, so he was, no doubt,
seated on the tribunal; and as the tribunal of the church and curia
exactly correspond,</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>HERE CÆSAR FELL!</p>
</div>

<p>The cupola of the church is one of the finest in Rome; the four
evangelists, at the angles, are by Domenichino.</p>

<p><i>From here we retrace our steps down the Via Chiavari, crossing
the Via Giubbonari, passing, on our left, the</i> <span class="smcap">Monte di Pietà</span>
(Uncle to Rome); <i>turn to left Via Pettinari; the first turning on the
right leads to the Piazza Capo di Ferri.</i> On the left, decorated
with statues, is the Spada Palace. In the vestibule of the law court,
upstairs, is</p>

<h4>THE STATUE OF POMPEY,</h4>

<p>at whose feet great Cæsar fell.</p>

<p>"There was a statue of Pompey, and it was a work which Pompey
had consecrated for an ornament to his theatre."</p>

<p>"Either by accident, or pushed hither by the conspirators, he
expired at the pedestal of Pompey's statue, and dyed it with his
blood" (Plutarch).</p>

<p>"Augustus removed the statue of Pompey from the senate house,
in which Julius Cæsar had been killed, and placed it under a marble
arch, fronting the curia attached to Pompey's theatre" (Suetonius,
"Aug." xxxi.).</p>

<p>The statue is eleven feet high, and was found in 1553 in the Vicolo
di Lentari; it was under two houses, and the proprietors could not
agree as to whom it should belong, when Pope Julius II. gave them
five hundred gold dollars for it, and presented it to Cardinal Capodifero.
In 1798&ndash;99 the French carried this statue to the Colosseum,
where they performed Voltaire's "Tragedy of Brutus" to the
original statue. To facilitate moving it, they cut off the extended
arm; hence the join.

<h4>THE SPADA PALACE GALLERY.</h4>

<p><i>Open every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday; fee, half lira each
to Museum and Gallery.</i></p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The vestibule where the statue of Pompey stands is public,
and is open all day. Resist the demands of the porter, who is generally
very rude.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Museum</span> on the ground-floor contains a good seated statue of
Aristotle, and nine reliefs formerly used, reversed, as the pavement
of S. Agnese outside the walls. 1. Paris on Mount Ida; 2. Bellerophon
watering Pegasus; 3. Amphion and Zethus; 4. Ulysses
and Diomedes robbing the Temple of Minerva; 5. Paris and &OElig;none;
6. Perseus and Andromeda; 7. Adonis; 8. Adrastus and Hypsipyla
finding the body of Archemorus; 9. Pasiphæ and Dædalus.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gallery</span> upstairs contains few good pictures. Catalogues in
each room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room.</span>&mdash;32. Lanfranco's Cain and Abel; 45. Guercino's David.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;9. Guido's Judith; 19. Poussin's Joseph and
Brethren; 17. Leonardo da Vinci's Dispute with the Doctors; 32. S.
John; 33. S. Lucia, by Guercino.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Room.</span>&mdash;20. Rape of Helen, by Guido; 33. Vandyck;

<p><i>In coming out of the Palace, turn to the right, keep straight on down
the</i> <span class="smcap">Via S. Paola alla Regola</span>. Some little way down is the church
of that name, on the right, said to have been built on the site where
S. Paul had a school. <i>Just beyond</i>, on the right, is the Via degli
Strengari; the house on the left, No. 2, is pointed out by Jewish tradition
as</p>

<h4>THE HIRED HOUSE OF S. PAUL.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."</p>

<p>"Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in
unto him."</p>

<p>Here, "Paul called the chief of the Jews together."</p>

<p>"When they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i>his</i> lodging."</p>
</div>

<p>The construction of the lower part of the house is brick-work of
the early empire. This agrees with the Jewish tradition, and we can
well understand that S. Paul would lodge somewhere near his kinsmen
the Jews. The doorway has one of its columns still; but it has
been turned from a round headway into a square one. One of the
windows on the left has still a round head; above this the house is
medieval. The lower part of the other houses here are Roman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p><i>To the left</i> of the house, take the <span class="smcap">Via di S. Bartolomeo dei Vaccinari</span>.
On the right, some remains of the columns of the Theatre of
Balbus have been built into a house, and remains exist under the
houses all round. In this street Rienzi was born; the exact house is
not known.</p>

<p><i>Keeping straight on, the</i> <span class="smcap">Via della Fiumara</span> is one of the dirtiest
in the Ghetto. <i>At its extremity, on the right, is the</i></p>

<h4>PONS FABRICIUS,</h4>

<p>now called Ponte dei Quattro Capi, from the four-headed Janus upon
its balustrades. From the inscription, and from Dion Cassius (xxxvii.
45), we learn that it was erected, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 61, by L. Fabricius, Curator
Viarum. Horace (S. ii. 3) says that "Stertinius advised the would-be
suicide Damasippus to return cheerfully from the Fabrician Bridge."
It has two arches. The bridge leads to</p>

<h4>THE ISLAND OF THE TIBER.</h4>

<p>"The Tarquins had sacrilegiously converted the best part of the
Campus Martius to their own use. When they were expelled, it happened
to be harvest time, and the sheaves then lay upon the ground;
but as it was consecrated, the people could not make use of it. A
great number of hands, therefore, took it up in baskets and threw it
into the river. The trees were also cut down and thrown in after
it, and the ground left entirely without fruit or produce for the
service of the god. A great quantity of different sorts of things
being thus thrown in together, they were not carried far by the current,
but only to the shallows, where the first heaps had stopped.
Finding no further passage, everything settled there, and the whole
was bound still firmer by the river; for that washed down to it a deal
of mud, which not only added to the mass, but served as a cement to
it, and the current, far from dissolving it, by its gentle pressure gave
it the greater firmness. The bulk and solidity of this mass received
continual additions, most of what was brought down by the Tiber
settling there. It was now an island sacred to religious uses. Several
temples and porticoes have been built upon it; and it is called in
Latin <i>inter duos pontes</i>&mdash;the island between the two bridges" (Plutarch,
in "Publicola").</p>

<p>The island in the Tiber is an alluvial formation, and thus far the
legend is correct in ascribing its origin to the accumulation of rubbish
and drifted sand. In remembrance of the vessel which bore the
statue of Æsculapius from Epidaurus to Rome, the entire island was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
faced with stone, and made to assume the form of a ship, in which
was placed the temple of the god.</p>

<p>Some of the immense blocks of travertine composing the facing,
and representing the hull of the ship, may still be seen in the monastery
garden of the Church of S. Bartolomeo in Isola. <i>Ladies are not
admitted to the monastery.</i></p>

<p>"In the island of the Tiber, just prior to the death of Otho, the
statue of Julius Cæsar turned from west to east, a circumstance said
likewise to have happened when Vespasian took on him the empire"
(Plutarch).</p>

<p>In the Piazza is a monument to SS. John, Francis, Bartholomew,
and Paulinus. The interior of the church is embellished with
fourteen ancient columns, and in the choir are the remains of an
early mosaic.</p>

<p>The island on the farther side is connected with the mainland by</p>

<h4>THE PONS CESTIUS,</h4>

<p>now called Ponte S. Bartolomeo. It was erected, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 45, by the
Prætor Lucius Cestius; the inscription records its restoration,
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 367, by the Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian. It
consists of a single arch. Over the bridge is <span class="smcap">Trastevere</span>, the inhabitants
of which claim to be descended from the ancient Romans: their
manners and customs are somewhat distinct from those of the inhabitants
of the other side of the river.</p>

<p><i>From the bridge</i> (<i>retracing our steps</i>) <i>a street leads into the Piazza
Montanara; turn to the right up the Via Montanara; on the right
is the</i> <span class="smcap">Church of S. Nicolo in Carcere</span>, built over three temples.</p>

<p><i>Entrance to see the substructions through the sacristy.</i></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLES OF JUNO SOSPITA, PIETY, AND HOPE.</h4>

<p>Three temples of the time of the republic, situated in one front, and
forming a group. Not only many columns, but also considerable
remains of the substructions have been preserved. The latter have
been rendered accessible by the recent excavations.</p>

<p>The largest of these temples, Piety, situated in the middle, is of
Ionic architecture. It is surrounded by a corridor, and is probably
the same erected to Piety by the son of M. Acilius Glabrio ten years
after the event, in fulfilment of a vow made by his father at the
battle of Thermopylæ, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 562, erected 572 (Livy, xl. 34). The
<i>left hand</i> temple is that of Juno Sospita (to keep in health), founded
by Cethægus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 195 (Livy, xxxii. 30, xxxiv. 53). The Temple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Hope is <i>on the right</i>. It was erected by Atilius Calatinus during
the first Punic War, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 248 (Livy xxi. 62, xxv. 7).</p>

<p>These temples were situated in the Forum Olitorium, the great
vegetable market of Rome, and outside the Servian wall. The
custodian shows a cell which he points out as the scene of the "Caritas
Romana." Visitor! "beware, beware! he's fooling thee." This is not
that Temple of Piety erected on the site of the house of the Roman
matron, or, according to some authorities, on the site of the Decemviral
Prisons; for Pliny and Solinus tell us that the sites of the
temple and prison were occupied by the Theatre of Marcellus.
According to Valerius Maximus (v. 4) and Pliny ("Natural History,"
vii. 36), it was a daughter who thus saved her mother's life, and
"they were henceforth provided for by the state." Festus says it
was her father.</p>

on the right is</i></p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF RIENZI.</h4>

</div></div>

<p>It was built from the remains of one of those medieval towers used
by the Romans as fortresses, and, as such, bore the name of the Torre
di Monzone. It was demolished by Arlotto degli Stefaneschi, in the
year 1313, in order to diminish the power of the Orsini, in whose
possession it was. An inscription on the ruin states the founder to
have been a certain Nicolas, the son of Crescentius and Theodora.
Hence it has been supposed that the Crescentius here mentioned is
identical with the celebrated consul who ruled over Rome <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 998;
an opinion strengthened by the fact of his wife having really borne
the name of Theodora. Rienzi is said to have been descended from
them. Pope Leo XIII. was descended through his mother from Rienzi.</p>

<h4>THE PONTE ROTTO,</h4>

<p>anciently the Pons Æmilius. This bridge, intended to unite the
nearer bank of the river with Trastevere, but rendered impassable by
the fall of several arches in 1598, whence its name of the Ponte Rotto,
was commenced in the censorship of M. Æmilius Lepidus and M.
Fulvius Nobilior, in the year of the city 573, and was completed by
P. Scipio Africanus and L. Mummius. From the first of these it took
its name. "Marcus Fulvius made contracts for piers for a bridge
over the Tiber; on which piers Publius Scipio Africanus and Lucius
Mummius, censors many years afterwards, caused the arches to be
raised" (Livy, xl. 51). It is the same from which the body of Elagabalus
was thrown with a stone attached to it, after having been
dragged through the Circus.</p>

<p>In January 1886, to the eternal disgrace of the acting mayor, Duke
Torlonia, and the municipal authorities of Rome, the remaining half
of the oldest bridge over the Tiber was wantonly and unnecessarily
destroyed in the works going on for the embankment of the river,
the city fathers leaving one arch in the centre of the river as a monument
of their folly. From this arch a suspension bridge is to be
thrown to the Trastevere side. The Cloaca Maxima has been diverted
into the Tiber below S. Paul's, in order to prevent the back-wash
into the city. <i>A little lower down was</i></p>

<h4>THE SUBLICIAN BRIDGE,</h4>

<p>in front of which Horatius displayed his valour. It was first erected,
<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 114, by Ancus Martius. By appointment of the oracle it was
built only of timber fastened with wooden pins; "for the Romans
considered it as an execrable impiety to demolish the wooden bridge,
which, we are told, was built without iron, and put together with
pins of wood only, by the direction of some oracle. The stone bridge
was built many ages after, when Æmilius was quæstor. Some, however,
inform us that the wooden bridge was not constructed in the
time of Numa, having the last hand put to it by Ancus Martius"
(Plutarch, in "Numa").</p>

<p>"Rome was in great danger of being taken, when Horatius Cocles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
and with him two others of the first rank&mdash;Herminius and Spurius
Lartius&mdash;stopped them at the bridge.... This man [Horatius], standing
at the head of the bridge, defended it against the enemy till the
Romans broke it down behind him. Then he plunged into the Tiber,
armed as he was, and swam to the other side, but was wounded in
the hip with a Tuscan spear" (Plutarch, in "Publicola"). Livy (ii. 10)
gives his prayer before plunging in: "Holy father Tiber, I beseech
thee to receive these arms, and this thy soldier, into thy propitious
stream." And</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p><i>Returning from the bridge, turn to the right. On our left is</i></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF PUDICITIA PATRICIA.</h4>

<p>The Temple of Patrician Chastity stood inside the wall of Servius
in the Forum of the Cattle-dealers. Livy (x. 23) says: "In the year
<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 456, a quarrel broke out among the matrons in the Temple
of Patrician Chastity, which stands in the cattle-market, near the
Round Temple of Hercules."</p>

<p>It was converted in 880 into the Church of <span class="smcap">S. Maria Egiziaca</span>.
It has four Ionic columns at the front, with four apparent columns
at the end, and seven on one side. A frieze of stucco, representing
heads of oxen, candelabra, and wreaths of flowers borne by children,
is on the entablature; it is 100 feet long by 50 wide. When it was
turned into a church the wall dividing the portico from the cella
was pulled down, and the columns of the portico were filled in to
make it longer for a church. It is the best specimen we have of a
republican temple.</p>

<p><i>Going down by the side of the temple, we come to</i></p>

<h4>THE ROUND TEMPLE OF HERCULES.</h4>

<p>This is the temple mentioned above by Livy, and we see the positions
agree with his statements. It is formed of twenty beautiful Corinthian
columns, only one of which, on the right side, is missing. Its
circumference is only 156 feet, and that of the cella 26 feet, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
height of the columns 32 feet. The walls within the portico are of
white marble (much of which still remains), and the pieces of it were
put together so as to have the appearance of one mass. The temple
stands on a base of tufa, showing early construction, but is a restoration
of the time of Vespasian.</p>

<a href="images/i-243l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This was probably the Temple of Hercules which Vitruvius (iii. 3)
says was erected by Pompey. Pliny (xxxiv. 19) says Myron made
the statue of Hercules which is in the Ædes Herculis, built by Pompey
the Great, near the Circus Maximus. Again (xxxv. 7) he speaks
of "the paintings of the poet Pacuvius, in the Temple of Hercules,
situated in the cattle-market."</p>

<h4>THE GRAND TEMPLE OF HERCULES.</h4>

<p>There were other temples to Hercules in the Forum Boarium, of
which we have some travertine remains behind the Church of S.
Maria in Cosmedin opposite. "The Romans afterwards built a magnificent
temple near the river Tiber, in honour of Hercules, and
instituted sacrifices to him out of the tenths" (Diodorus, iv. 1). "In
<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 534 a supplication was ordered to be performed by individuals
at the Temple of Hercules" (Livy, xxi. 62). This was destroyed
by Pope Adrian I., <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 772&ndash;795. "By the infinite labour of the
people, employed during a whole year, Adrian threw down an
immense structure of Tiburtine stone to enlarge the Church of S.
Maria in Cosmedin" (Anastasias).</p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARIA IN COSMEDIN</h4>

<p>is on the site of a temple to Ceres and Proserpine. "Spurius Cassius
consecrated the Temple of Ceres, Bacchus, and Proserpine, which
stands at the end of the great circus, and is built over the starting-places,
and which Aulus Postumius, the dictator, had vowed when
upon the point of engaging the Latins," <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 258 (Dionysius, vi. 94).
"It was restored by Augustus, and consecrated by Tiberius" (Tacitus,
"Annals," ii. 49). The temple fronted north, and in the left-hand
aisle of the church are three of the columns of the portico <i>in situ</i>;
three of the side columns are in the portico of the church, and three
others in the sacristy, where there is part of a mosaic from old S.
Peter's, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 705.</p>

<p>In the portico is a large mask of stone called the Bocca della
Verità (Mouth of Truth). A suspected person, on making an affirmation,
was required to put his hand in the mouth of this mask, in the
belief that if he told an untruth the mouth would close upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
hand. Several columns of the old temple are immured in the walls,
and the aisles are formed by twenty ancient marble columns; the
pavement is of beautiful <i>opus Alexandrinum</i>. <i>Behind</i> the altar is
a fine bishop's chair, and a Greek picture of the Virgin and Child,
also some old frescoing behind a panel on the left. <i>Opposite</i> the
church is a beautiful fountain of Tritons supporting a basin.</p>

<p><i>Resuming our ramble down the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Marmorata</span>, <i>turn left coming
out of the church, passing under</i> an archway, the remains of the
Porta Trigemina in the Servian Wall. <i>The road runs for a short
distance by the Tiber, on the opposite side of which is the</i> <span class="smcap">Ripa
Grande</span>, <i>or quay. Taking the road to the right, past a stone-yard,
Marmorata, by the river, brings us to</i></p>

<h4>THE EMPORIUM,</h4>

<p>another important building of the time of the Republic, of which we
have considerable remains. The exact date of its foundation is not
recorded, but a porticus, or arcade, was made to it, and it was paved
about the year 560 of Rome, or 193 <span class="s08">B.C.</span> It was the great warehouse
for the port of Rome for merchandise brought by vessels coming
from the sea. There was another port at the Ripetta for provisions
brought <i>down</i> the river in boats.</p>

<p>The Emporium was to ancient Rome what the docks are to London
and Liverpool. This great building formed three sides of a quadrangle,
the fourth being open to the quay on the bank of the Tiber,
with a zigzag path down the face of the cliff and surface of the quay.
This was excavated by the Pontifical Government, under the direction
of Baron Visconti. It was remarkably perfect; the walls against
the cliff were faced with <i>opus reticulatum</i> of the time of Hadrian,
and a large number of blocks of valuable marbles were found here.
A little further up the river an <i>amphora</i> is cut in the wall of the
quay, to indicate the place for landing wine and oil. The portion of
the Emporium now remaining belongs to the portico or arcade. There
are said to be extensive cellars under the other remains, forming a
lower story of the buildings. A new quarter is in course of erection
here.</p>

<p>The Emporium, and the quay by the side of it, called the <span class="smcap">Marmorata</span>,
or Marble Wharf, are situated at the lower end of the great
Port of Rome for sea-going vessels, which port extended about half
a mile up the river, with the Salaria, or Salt Wharf, near the middle
of it. Above this, and nearly opposite the point where the Almo
falls into the Tiber, a little below the Temple of Hercules, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
several large stone corbels with holes through them, through which
a pole was passed for the purpose of fastening a chain across the
river for holding vessels against the force of the stream. There are
similar corbels in the wall of the Marmorata for the same purpose,
only these corbels are left plain; those at the upper end of the port
are carved in the form of lions' heads of the early character called
Etruscan. These corbels at the two ends mark the extent of the
Port of Rome, made originally in the year 577 of Rome, and were
discovered by Mr. J. H. Parker, C.B.</p>

<p><i>Regaining the main road, at a little distance we pass under an arch
of the aqueduct which supplied the Emporium with water. It is called
the</i> <span class="smcap">Arco di S. Lazaro</span>. <i>We next turn off to the right, and ascend</i></p>

<h4>MONS TESTACCIO,</h4>

<p>formed of fragments of earthenware, chiefly of amphoræ. We know
from those remaining at Pompeii that the amphoræ which formed
that branch of commerce were often six feet high. Great numbers
of these got broken in landing, and all were thrown on this heap, as
they were not allowed to be thrown into the Tiber. There is also
said to have been a manufactory of amphoræ and other earthenware
at this spot, many of the fragments found here being the refuse of a
great manufactory. This is supposed to have been the great manufactory
of earthenware for the city of Rome for several centuries;
and this supposition may account for the enormous quantity of
such refuse that has accumulated on the spot, so as to form a hill.
Tombs proving its comparatively recent origin were discovered beneath
it in the year 1696. It is 110 feet high, and surmounted by
a cross. The view from the top is very fine. <i>Close by is the</i></p>

<h4>PROTESTANT CEMETERY.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">"The spirit of the spot shall lead</p>
<p>Thy footsteps to a slope of green access."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The cemetery is an open space among the ruins, covered in winter
with violets and daisies. "It might make one in love with death,
to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place." So wrote
Shelley, whose heart is contained in a tomb at the top left-hand
corner of the new ground, his body having been burned upon the
shore at Lerici, where it was thrown up by the sea. <i>Passing into
the old ground</i>, "in the romantic and lovely cemetery under the
pyramid which is the tomb of Cestius, and the mossy walls and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
towers, now mouldering and desolate, which formed the circuit of
ancient Rome" (Shelley), here, on the right of the entrance, "lies
one whose name was writ in water," Keats desiring this to be engraved
upon his tomb. A fellow-poet says, "You feel an interest
here, a sympathy you were not prepared for; you are yourself in
a foreign land, and they are for the most part your countrymen,
Englishmen."</p>

<p><i>In returning from the Cemetery, nearly opposite the exit, a lane, Via
S. Maria, leads up to the</i> <span class="smcap">Aventine Hill</span>. The square at the top
is decorated with military trophies of the Knights of Malta. <i>A
door on the left leads to</i> their Priory; it contains a key-hole;&mdash;look
through it, 'tis worth your while.</p>

<h4>IL PRIORATO.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Open Wednesday and Saturday.</i>)</p>

<p>Built upon the site of the Temple of the Bona Dea, and where,
according to some accounts, Remus took up his position to consult
the flight of birds. On the right in entering is the tomb of Bishop
Spinelli, an antique sarcophagus representing Minerva and the Muses.
The church contains several tombs of the Knights of Malta, to whom
it belonged, and who still exist and hold property in Rome, their encampment
being in the Via Condotti; amongst others, there is a tomb
erected to Brother Bartholomew Caraffa, Grand Master, died 1450.</p>

<p><i>Beyond, on the left, is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. ALEXIUS,</h4>

<p>on the site of the Armilustrum, where the Sabine king, Titus Tatius,
was buried. In the left aisle are a well and staircase belonging to
the house of S. Alexius's parents, which formerly stood by the side
of the church, where, after his return from his pilgrimage, he was
allowed to live unrecognized by them. There is a very interesting
fresco of S. Alexius's life on the walls of the underground
Church of S. Clemente. (See <a href="#Page_228">page 228</a>.)</p>

<p><i>A little further, on the left, is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. SABINA,</h4>

<p>on the site of the saint's house, and formerly of the Temple of Juno
Regina founded by Camillus. The church has been much restored
at different times.</p>

<p>In the chapel on the right of the high altar is Sassoferrato's
Virgin, with the rosary. The Chapel of S. Catherine, painted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Odazzi, is worthy of note. In the convent garden is an orange-tree
planted by S. Dominic.</p>

<p><i>Following on the road, we take the first turning to the right; some
little way down, on the left, is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. PRISCA,</h4>

<p>supposed to occupy the site of the house, some remains of which can
be seen in the crypt, in which she was baptized by S. Peter. Only
open on January 18. Supposed to have been formerly the site of
the Temple of Diana founded by Servius Tullius.</p>

<p><i>Down the hill, and up the opposite one, leads to the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. SABA,</h4>

<p>built on the site of the house of Silvia, the mother of Gregory the
Great, who used to send every day to her son on the C&oelig;lian a silver
basin containing soup. Uninteresting, and only open on the saint's
day, December 5.</p>

<p><i>At the foot of the hill, on the left corner of the two roads, is the</i></p>

<h4>CAVE OF AQUEDUCTS,</h4>

<p>a large stone quarry, intersected in all directions by aqueducts.
Some of them are cut out of the solid tufa, others built in passages
cut through the tufa; some are blocked up with mud deposit, others
with stalactite; some run for a considerable distance, others being
broken in, in extracting the tufa. They present altogether a curious
and interesting study.</p>

<p><i>Opposite S. Prisca, in the vineyard of Prince Torlonia, are remains
of the</i></p>

<h4>WALL OF THE LATINS,</h4>

<p>built by the Latins under Ancus Martius, when he added the Aventine
to the city.</p>

<p>The cliff has been scarped to the depth of 60 feet, and a terrace
made on the ledge on which the wall stands, consisting of blocks of
tufa. It was originally 12 feet thick, and in one part an arch is
introduced for catapults, similar to those we have seen in ruins on
the Palatine. The back of this part of the wall is a mass of concrete
backing. At the foot of the wall was a trench, afterwards filled up,
in which deep wells have been made for interments. Under the hill
of S. Saba, below the cottage opposite, are traces of another early
fortification formed of masses of concrete, originally faced with large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
blocks of tufa. The road here ran through the Porta Randusculana,
in the fortifications of the seven hills.</p>

<p><i>In this vineyard are also some remains of</i></p>

<h4>THE BATHS OF SURA,</h4>

<p>cousin of Trajan. These remains have only been partly explored,
and are of great extent.</p>

<p><i>On the opposite side of the road, in another vineyard</i>, are some
massive remains of the aqueduct and reservoir of these baths, from
the top of which there is a most enjoyable view of the city in general
and the Palatine in particular. "Sura, the neighbour of the Aventine
Diana, beholds at less distance than others the contests of the
great circus" (Martial, vi. 64).</p>

<p><i>In this vineyard are also some remains called the</i></p>

<h4>HOUSE OF AQUILA AND PRISCILLA.</h4>

<p>It consists of some chambers of reticulated work and a well of the
early empire; the latter extends under S. Prisca. "Greet Priscilla
and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus.... Likewise greet the church
that is in their house" (Rom. xvi. 3, 5).</p>

<p><i>From the vineyard turn to the right. Some little way down on the
right is the</i> entrance to the Jewish Cemetery. This hill was the
ancient Clivus Publicus, a continuation of the Vicus Tuscus, and up
which the sacred processions used to come to the Aventine.</p>

<p><i>In the valley below us was</i></p>

<h4>THE CIRCUS MAXIMUS.</h4>

<p>"Tarquinius also built the great circus which lies between the
Aventine and Palatine Hills. He was the first who erected covered
seats round it; for till then the spectators stood on scaffolds supported
by poles. And he divided the places between the thirty curiæ. He
assigned to each curia a particular part, so that every spectator was
seated in the place that belonged to him. This work also became in
time one of the most beautiful and most admirable structures in
Rome. The circus is 3½ stadia in length, and 400 feet in breadth.
Round the two greater sides, and one of the lesser, runs a canal, 10
feet deep and as many broad, to receive the water; behind the canal,
porticoes are erected three stories high, of which the lowest has stone
seats, as in the theatres, raised a little above the level of the ground,
and the two upper porticoes have wooden seats. The two larger porticoes
are connected into one, and joined together by means of the lesser,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and, meeting, form a semicircular figure; so that all three constitute
one amphitheatral portico of 8 stadia, capable of receiving one hundred
and fifty thousand persons. The other lesser side is left uncovered,
and contains several arched starting-places for the horses,
which are all opened at one signal. On the outside of the circus
runs another portico of one story, which has shops in it, and habitations
over them. In this portico are entrances and ascents for the
spectators at every shop, contrived in such a manner that so many
thousand persons may go in and out without any molestation" (Dionysius,
iii. 69).</p>

<p>This description is evidently of the building as it stood in the
days of Augustus. Founded by Tarquin, it was extended by Cæsar,
and kept in repair and embellished by Augustus, Claudius, Domitian,
Trajan, Constantine, and Theodoric. (See Suetonius, "Cæsar,"
xxxix.; Pliny, xxxv. 24, xxxvi. 15; Livy, vii. 20, i. 35.)</p>

<p>The valley in which it stood was originally called the Murzian
Valley. Here Romulus gave the games when the Romans ran off
with the Sabine women. The stream of the Almo runs through it:
this branch of the Almo was taken from the main stream, about six
miles from Rome, and made to pass through the Circus to supply
with water the canal made by Cæsar which separated the spectators
from the arena.</p>

<p>Remains of the curve can be seen at the C&oelig;lian end, and some
fragments of seats exist under the Palatine.</p>

<p><i>Crossing the site of the Circus, on our right, standing back, is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. ANASTASIA,</h4>

<p>underneath which is part of two massive tufa towers of the wall of the
kings that surrounded the two hills; and part of the old street called
after Julius Cæsar which passed by the side of the Circus, facing on
to which are a row of shops, behind which are some remains of the
seats of the Circus Maximus.</p>

<h4>THE LUPERCAL</h4>

<p>"was a grotto consecrated to Pan, the most ancient and the most
honoured of all the Arcadian gods. It was surrounded by a wood,
and is contiguous to the Palatine buildings, and is to be seen in the
way that leads to the Circus. Near it stands a temple in which
a statue is placed representing a wolf suckling two children,&mdash;they
are in brass, and of ancient workmanship" (Dionysius, i. 76). This
grotto, with the water still flowing out of the rock, still exists under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the street at the corner of the Via de Cerchi, but it is not at present
accessible. It was discovered by Mr. J. H. Parker, C.B., in 1869;
and he found remains of the work of Augustus, who says, in the
"Mon. Ancyr.," "<i>Lupercal ... feci.</i>" We have been into it, and it
exactly answers the description of Dionysius.</p>

<p><i>From the church we follow the</i> <span class="smcap">Via di S. Teodoro</span>. <i>A decline on the
left leads to</i></p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF JANUS (?),</h4>

<p>a double arch of considerable magnitude, believed to be that of the
four-headed Janus, the appearance of the structure involuntarily
recalling the celebrated sanctuary of that god in the Forum, with
which, however, it must not be confounded. There is no authority
for calling it the Arch of Janus; we do not know what it was called
by the Romans. In the sides of the piers which support the arch
are twelve niches, apparently intended for the reception of statues.
In one of these is a doorway leading up a narrow staircase to a
chamber in the interior of the building, probably used as a place for
business.</p>

<p>This singular building, which in its present condition has a somewhat
quaint appearance, has evidently been intended for a place of
sale. Being erected over the spot where the two roads intersecting
the cattle-market met, it seems to have marked the central point of
the traffic carried on in this space.</p>

<p>It is of white marble, old material re-used, and probably of the
time of Constantine. Domitian erected several arches to Janus, but
this is not good enough for his time.</p>

<p><i>By its side is</i></p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF THE SILVERSMITHS AND CATTLE-DEALERS.</h4>

<p>We are indebted to this inconsiderable little monument&mdash;stated in
the inscription to have been raised by the silversmiths and cattle-dealers
to the imperial family of Septimius Severus&mdash;for the important information
that the Forum Boarium, mentioned in the legends of the
foundation of Rome, was situated on this spot. The sculptures with
which the arch is ornamented are much defaced, and hidden from
view on one side by the Church of S. Giorgio. Those in the interior
represent sacrifices offered by the emperor and his sons. On one of
the side piers is the figure of Hercules, evidently having reference to
this locality, which was consecrated to him, and in the neighbourhood
of which he had actually erected the Ara Maxima. At the
back is a representation of a ploughman with a yoke of oxen, also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
in allusion to the myths, the different threads of which all unite at
this point.</p>

<p>On the inside <i>right</i> are the effigies of Septimius and his wife Julia;
and opposite them were Caracalla and Geta, but the latter has been
cut out, leaving only his brother. On the pilasters, the capitals of
which are Roman, we discover among various field-badges the portraits
of the emperor, his wife, and one of his sons; that of Geta
having been obliterated after his murder, by the order of Caracalla.</p>

<p>It is rather a misnomer to call this an arch, as it has a flat top.</p>

<p><i>Adjoining is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. GIORGIO IN VELABRO,</h4>

<p>founded in the fourth century. The architrave above the portico (of
the thirteenth century) is where Rienzi affixed his proclamation
announcing, "In a short time the Romans will return to their ancient
good estate." It is seldom opened, except on its festival, January 20th.
The aisles are formed by sixteen different columns, no doubt the
plunder of some other building. It is dedicated to the patron saint
of England, a piece of whose banner is preserved beneath the altar.</p>

<p><i>Proceeding down the low brick archway opposite brings us to</i></p>

<h4>THE CLOACA MAXIMA,</h4>

<p>originally made by Tarquinius Superbus in the year 138 of Rome, or
530 years before Christ: part of the actual construction appears
to be original and of that time. It is built of the larger blocks of
tufa, and has a round-headed vault. The German theory is, that
this great drain was originally open at the top, and not vaulted over
till the time of Camillus, after the capture of Veii in the war with
the Etruscans; but the construction does not agree with this. The
additional branch of the Cloaca made by Agrippa to carry off the
water from his thermæ near the Pantheon (to supply which the Aqua
Virgo was made), is of brick, after the fashion of his time. This can
be seen at the junction near the Church of S. Giorgio in Velabro or
the Janus Quadrifrons. Several natural streams of water are collected
in this great drain, and still run through it. One, from the
Quirinal, runs straight between the Palatine and the Capitol; a
second comes from the eastern side of the Palatine and the Arch of
Titus; a third runs from the Capitol, the spring being in the lower
chamber of the Prison of S. Peter. All these met near the Forum
Romanum, and formed the Lake of Curtius, which was drained by
the great Cloaca. But this drain is not so low down as the lake is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
deep; consequently there is always a swamp there, even now, after
much rain. Two other streams fall into it near the Janus,&mdash;one
from the direction of the Pantheon; the other from the western side
of the Palatine, coming out of the cave called the Lupercal, where
the water gushes out from under the arch with great force. This is
called the Aqua Argentina, or the Silvery Water, either from its beautiful
clearness, or because it went through the silversmiths' quarter.</p>

<p><i>Regaining the</i> <span class="smcap">Via S. Teodoro</span>, <i>turn left, under the Palatine.
On the right is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. TEODORO,</h4>

<p>founded by Adrian I., 772&ndash;795, and rebuilt, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1451, by Nicholas
V. This church, from being round, has been called after all sorts of
temples, but there is nothing whatever to show that it was once a
pagan temple. It belongs to a burial fraternity. Over the altar is
a mosaic, of the time of Adrian I., of our Saviour between SS. Peter
and Paul. The Roman women bring their children here every
Thursday morning to be blessed, after their recovery from sickness.
It is a very ancient custom, and may have originated from the sick
people who used to resort to the Fountain of Juturna to drink the
waters.

<h4>THE PIAZZA DI SPAGNA.</h4>

<p>This square may be considered as the centre of the English and
Americans in Rome. Here they come for most of their requirements,
and here a great many live. At No. 1, <i>the corner</i>, is the well-known

for the representation of naval fights. The fleets were as numerous
as those employed in real engagements" (Suetonius, "Dom." 4).</p>

Conception</span>, found in the Campo Marzo, is supported by statues of
Moses, David, Isaiah, and Ezekiel. Its summit is crowned by a
statue of the Virgin, in bronze, designed by Poletti. It was erected
in 1854. <i>Beyond</i> is the Collegio di Propaganda Fide, founded in

<h4>THE FOUNTAIN OF TREVI,</h4>

<p>"which draws its precious water from a source far beyond the walls,
whence it flows hitherward through old subterranean aqueducts, and
sparkles forth as pure as the virgin who first led Agrippa to its well-spring
by her father's door. It is a great palace front, with niches
and many bas-reliefs, out of which looks Agrippa's legendary virgin
and several of the allegoric sisterhood; while at its base appears
Neptune with his floundering steeds, and Tritons blowing their
horns, and other artificial fantasies. At the foot of the palatial
façade is strewn, with careful art and ordered irregularity, a broad
and broken heap of massive rock. Over the central precipice the
water falls in a semicircular cascade; and from a hundred crevices,
on all sides, snowy jets gush up and streams spout out of the mouths
and nostrils of stone monsters; while other rivulets that had run
wild come leaping from one rude step to another, over stones that
are mossy and ferns planted by nature. Finally, the water, tumbling,
sparkling, and dashing, with never-ceasing murmur, pours itself
into a great marble-brimmed reservoir. The tradition is, that by
taking a parting draught, and throwing a sou in, the traveller will
return to Rome, whatever obstacles seem to beset his path." Such is
Hawthorne's description of this beautiful fountain.</p>

In the course of the alterations, in 1873, the bodies of SS.
Philip and James the Less were found enclosed in a marble sarcophagus.
A new extensive crypt, decorated after the style of the

<h4>THE FORUM OF TRAJAN.</h4>

<p>This was the largest and grandest of all the fora, being built to one
design by the celebrated architect Apollodorus of Damascus (Dion
Cassius). No author has given us any detailed account of the beautiful
group of buildings that formed this forum, but what passages
there are tend to show its magnificence. There was first of all an
open space, or the forum proper, surrounded by a double row of
shops, one above the other. In the centre of this space was the
colossal equestrian statue of the emperor (Marcellinus, xvi. 10).
Beyond this, crossing the whole width of the forum, was the basilica
called, after the family name of the emperor, Ulpia. Beyond this
was the celebrated pillar, behind which stood the Temple of Trajan,
with the libraries on either side. The portion excavated is only a
small piece of the whole, which extends under the houses all round.
The size of the basilica can be made out from the gray granite pillars
which once supported the roof. It was sometimes called the Hall of
Liberty, from the slaves receiving their freedom here.</p>

<h4>THE COLUMN OF TRAJAN.</h4>

<p>A magnificent marble pillar, the pedestal of which concealed the
chamber where the ashes of the emperor were deposited. The bas-reliefs
on the basement are among the most beautiful decorations of
ancient or modern times; they represent the arms taken from the
Dacians, against whom Trajan had made several campaigns. It
marks the height of the Quirinal Hill, cut away to make the open
space for the Forum of Trajan in which it stands. A series of bas-reliefs,
representing the Dacian war, forms a spiral round the shaft
of the pillar. Erected <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 114. It is 127 feet high, including the
base, and is surmounted by a statue of S. Peter, 11 feet high, placed
there by Sixtus V. in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The pillar is composed of thirty-four blocks of white marble. The
reliefs are two feet high at the bottom, and gradually increase in
size as they go upwards, thus making the figures at the top and
bottom seem of equal size. There are two thousand five hundred
figures, besides animals and other details.</p>

<p>Dion Cassius (Xiphilin, Trajan) says: "He erected in the forum
that bears his name a vast pillar, as well to serve as a receptacle for
his bones as to be a monument of his magnificence to posterity.
In good earnest, it was a piece of work that could not be finished
without extraordinary expense, because it was necessary to cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
through a mountain as high as the pillar, to make the level for the
forum."</p>

<p>"The bones of Trajan were put into the pillar we have mentioned;
and, to reverence his memory, sports were celebrated for several
years after, which were called Parthica" (Dion Cassius, "Hadrian").</p>

<p>"Trajan, of all the emperors, was buried within the city. His
bones, being put up in a golden urn, lie in the forum which he built,
under a pillar, whose height is 144 feet, Roman" (Eutropius).</p>

<h4>THE FORUM OF AUGUSTUS.</h4>

<p>"The reason of his building a new forum was the vast increase in
the population, and the number of cases to be tried in the courts;
for which the two already existing not affording sufficient space, it
was thought necessary to have a third. He placed statues of the
great Roman generals in both the porticoes of his forum. In building
his forum, he restricted himself in the site, not presuming to
compel the owners of the neighbouring houses to give up their property"
(Suetonius, "Augustus," lvi.).</p>

<p>It was restored by the Emperor Hadrian (Spartianus).</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF MARS ULTOR,</h4>

<p>the Avenger. Vowed by Augustus at the battle of Philippi, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 42,
and erected by him in the centre of his new forum.</p>

<p>Three beautiful pillars, and part of the wall of the cella and of the
roof of the vestibule, still exist near the Arco dei Pantani, which owes
its medieval name to the marshes caused by the water collecting in this
neighbourhood. They stand upon a substruction only excavated a
few years ago, and present one of the finest specimens extant of a
temple, all the essential parts of which have been preserved. The
gigantic walls of rectangular blocks of tufa, into which the travertine
arch already mentioned was introduced for the purpose of forming a
communication with the other part of the city, are most imposing,
and formed part of the second wall of Rome and the boundary of the
Forum of Augustus.

<p>"The Temple of Mars was built in fulfilment of a vow made during
the war of Philippi, undertaken by him to avenge his (adopted)
father's murder. He ordained that the senate should always assemble
there when they met to deliberate respecting wars and
triumphs; that thence should be despatched all those who were sent
into the provinces in the command of armies; and that in it those
who returned victorious from the wars should lodge the trophies of
their triumphs" (Suetonius, "Augustus," xxix.).</p>

<p>"The Emperor Augustus, being consul with Caninius Gallus,
gratified the eyes and minds of the Roman people, on the occasion
of dedicating the Temple to Mars, with the most magnificent
spectacles of gladiators and a sea-fight" (Velleius Paterculus, ii.
100).</p>

<p>By entering the stonemason's yard, <i>opposite</i> the temple, we can
see the travertine niches built by Augustus up against the wall of
the kings, to receive the statues which he put up in the porticoes.</p>

<h4>THE FORUM OF NERVA.</h4>

<p>"Domitian erected a forum, which is now called Nerva's" (Suetonius,
"Domitian," v.). It was known by several names, being
called after Domitian, because he commenced it; Nerva, because he
finished it; Pervium, because it was a thoroughfare; Pallas and
Minerva, from the temple that stood in it, and which was destroyed
by Pope Paul V. to build the fountain on the Janiculum; it was
also called Transitorium, because a street passed through it for
traffic. The only remains left are, <i>on the right</i>,</p>

<h4>THE ALTAR OF MINERVA,</h4>

<p>the prettiest bit of ruin in Rome, consisting of Corinthian columns,
which support an architrave adorned with a frieze, and divided
by ressauts, and an attic above. On the attic is a colossal figure
of Minerva, represented in relief as the patroness of labour; on
the architrave the goddess appears engaged in instructing young
girls in various female occupations, and in punishing the insolence
of Arachne, who had ventured to compete with her in the labours of
the loom.</p>

<p>The wall upon which this altar stands was also a piece of the wall
of the kings: in it was evidently a gateway, which was filled in
when the wall was utilized for the altar. In the yard of the large
new house opposite remains of a tower can be seen, probably the
tower called Turris Mamilia. (See Festus.)</p>

<p><i>Leaving this ruin on our right, we proceed up the Via Croce Bianca,
into the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Madonna dei Monti</span>, <i>the district of the Suburra.</i>
(<i>Carriages must proceed straight on down the Via di Torre di Conti,
and turn up the first street to the left.</i>)</p>

<h4>SITE OF THE HOUSE OF POMPEY.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Torre di Conti</span>, <i>on the right</i>, is a massive tower of the
middle ages, built as a fortress, and supposed to stand on the site of
the Temple of the Earth. "Lenæus, the grammarian, opened a
school in the Carinæ, near the Temple of the Earth, where stood
the house of the Pompeys" (Suetonius, "Grammarians," xv.).
"Tiberius removed from Pompey's house in the Carinæ" (Suetonius,
"Tiberius," xv.). "The house of Cassius was demolished; and to
this day the place remains void, except that part on which they
afterwards built the Temple of the Earth, which stands in the street
leading to the Carinæ" (Dionysius, viii. 79).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p><i>Going up that street</i>, we come to some old steps, <i>on our right</i>, at
the top of which is the lane that led down from the Carinæ to
the Vicus Cyprius, across which was the Sister's Yoke (Dionysius,
iii. 22).</p>

<p>The house at the top of the steps was the</p>

<h4>HOUSE OF LUCREZIA BORGIA.</h4>

<p>Here Cæsar Borgia, Francesco, Duke of Gandia, and Lucrezia,
supped with their mother Vanozza, on the evening that Cæsar
assassinated the duke, and had his body thrown into the Tiber,
where it was afterwards found by a fisherman, pierced with nine
wounds. <i>The dark archway leads to the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. PETER IN VINCOLI.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>The Chains of Peter.</i>)</p>

<p>It has three aisles, with twenty Doric columns of Greek marble,
and two of granite, which support the middle arch. On the first
altar, to the right, there is S. Augustin, by Guercino. On the right
of the high altar is the famous statue of <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, by <span class="smcap">Michael
Angelo</span>, rendered hideous by two horns sticking out from the forehead.
Although we read that Moses was a horny man, it does not
follow that he had horns, but that his flesh was hard like horn. The
S. Margherita, in the adjacent chapel, is by Guercino; the tribune
of the high altar was painted by I. Coppi. The new confessional,
built by Pius IX., contains the tomb of the seven Maccabees. Here
also are preserved the chains of S. Peter. The last altar but one
of the other aisle has a S. Sebastian, a mosaic of the seventh century.
In the sacristy there are the Liberation of S. Peter, by Domenichino;
a Holy Family and Faith, of the school of G. Romano. Guido Reni's
Hope was in this church, but it has been replaced by a copy, the
original having been sold to an Irish gentleman.</p>

<p><i>From the front of the church a lane on our left</i>, <span class="smcap">Via della Polveriera</span>,
<i>leads, left</i> (<i>carriage right</i>), <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Labicane</span>, <i>a short distance
up which is the entrance to</i></p>

<h4>NERO'S GOLDEN HOUSE.</h4>

<p><i>Entrance through a gate on the left; one of the custodi speaks
English. Fee, one lira; Sundays, free.</i></p>

<p>"He completed his palace by continuing it from the Palatine to
the Esquiline, calling the building at first only 'The Passage;' but
after it was burned down and rebuilt, 'The Golden House.' Of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
dimensions and furniture it may be sufficient to say this much:&mdash;The
porch was so high that there stood in it a colossal statue of himself 120
feet in height; and the space included in it was so ample that it had
triple porticoes a mile in length, and a lake like a sea, surrounded with
buildings which had the appearance of a city. Within its area were
corn-fields, vineyards, pastures, and woods, containing a vast number
of animals of various kinds, both wild and tame. In other parts it
was entirely overlaid with gold, and adorned with jewels and mother-of-pearl.
The supper-rooms were vaulted, and compartments of the
ceilings, inlaid with ivory, were made to revolve and scatter flowers,
while they contained pipes which shed scents upon the guests. The
chief banqueting room was circular, and revolved perpetually, night
and day, in imitation of the motion of the celestial bodies. Upon
the dedication of this magnificent house Nero said, in approval of it,
'that he had now a dwelling fit for a man'" (Suetonius, "Nero").</p>

<p>On the left of the entrance are the remains of the <span class="smcap">Oratorio of S.
Felicita</span>, a Christian church of the sixth century. The rooms on
the left of the <span class="smcap">Passage</span>, substructions formed by Hadrian, are supposed
to have been used as private habitations in the middle ages.

seen. <span class="smcap">Long Corridor</span>, penetrated into by Raphael and Giovanni da

it was the notice equal to our "Commit no nuisance."</p>

<p><i>Retracing our steps</i> down the corridor, and crossing some chambers,
we come to the <span class="smcap">Tricliniarium</span>, or summer banqueting room,
with the winter rooms on each side, having a southern aspect.
At the end of this room there was originally a garden; and in
the basin of the fountain was the porphyry vase now in the circular
hall of the Vatican Museum. Beyond this is the <span class="smcap">Cavædium</span>, an open
court or garden, from which the surrounding apartments received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
their light. It was surrounded on three sides with columns, and in the
centre was a fountain: it was subsequently occupied by the substruction
arches of the baths. Adjoining is the <span class="smcap">Corridor of Rhea Sylvia</span>,
so called from the fresco representing the conception of Romulus and
Remus. In another room is a representation of Venus and the Doves.</p>

<h4>THE BATHS OF HADRIAN.</h4>

<p>On the Plan, the dark lines show the remains of Nero's Palace,
which was nearly destroyed by the Flavian emperors. The remains
left were used by Hadrian for the underground part of his thermæ;
and by building walls over the courts and gardens he formed a large
platform. The light lines show his work. The circular wall in
front supported the seats for the stadium attached to the baths
above. Remains of some of the large halls of the baths can be seen in
the vineyards above the House of Nero. Some remains of these baths
exist under the Church of S. Martino. These baths are generally
ascribed to Titus; but the construction, <i>opus reticulatum</i>, within
bands of brick, shows that they are of the time of Hadrian.</p>

<p><i>Turn to the left on coming out. A short way up the road, on the
right, is the entrance to the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. CLEMENT,</h4>

<p>belonging to the Irish Dominicans, of which the late Father Mullooly
was prior, to whose instrumentality we are indebted for the
discovery of the ancient church, and the Temple of Mithras beneath
it, under the present edifice. On some occasions (November 23rd,
February 2nd, and the second Monday in Lent) they are illuminated.
Father Mullooly has written a book on his discoveries; it can be
purchased of the sacristan, and will be found very interesting.</p>

<p>The excavations have been carried out by voluntary subscriptions,
and visitors are expected to make a donation in furtherance of this
object. A book for the names and amounts will be found in the
sacristy.</p>

<h5>UPPER CHURCH.</h5>

<p>The usual entrance from the street is by a side door, but the proper
entrance is by a gate with a Gothic canopy of the thirteenth
century, which originally formed part of the earlier basilica, thence
through the atrium and quadriporticus, the only perfect ones of
Rome. The aisles are formed by sixteen ancient pillars of different
materials and orders. In the middle of the nave is the choir (514&ndash;22)
from the earlier basilica; on each side are the ambones. The walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
are adorned with Christian emblems, and a monogram of Agios&mdash;Holy.
The nave is separated from the high altar by an ancient marble
screen. Behind is the presbytery, which contains an ancient episcopal
chair, with the name of Anastasius, who was titular cardinal of
the church in 1108, engraved upon it. Upon the vault is a mosaic
of 1297, representing Christ on the Cross, from the foot of which
issue the four rivers of Paradise, with shepherds and their flocks,
and peacocks. On the face of the arch is a mosaic of the time of
Paschal II.&mdash;our Saviour; on either side two angels, and the emblems
of the four evangelists; below are S. Peter, S. Clement, Jeremiah, S.
Paul, S. Lawrence, and Isaiah; at the bottom, Bethlehem and Jerusalem,
with the mystic lamb and sheep. In the chapel, on the right,
the statue of S. John is by Simone; on the left, the picture of the
Virgin is by Conca. The monument composed of two half-columns,
with basket-work capitals and foliage reliefs, is to Cardinal Venerio,
who died in 1479. <i>To the left on entering</i>, in the Chapel of the
Passion, are the interesting frescoes by Masaccio (much spoilt by
restoration), representing the Crucifixion, &amp;c., and events from the
lives of SS. Clement and Catherine. <i>Outside</i> the arch, the Annunciation,
and S. Christopher carrying the infant Christ over a stream;
<i>within</i>, S. Catherine forced to Idolatry, Instruction of the King's
Daughter in Prison, Dispute with the Doctors, Miracle of her Deliverance,
Martyrdom. Opposite is the history of S. Clement.
<i>Proceeding into the sacristy</i>, which is adorned with paintings of
various interesting parts of the more ancient buildings, <i>a wide stair
conducts to the</i></p>

<h5>LOWER CHURCH,</h5>

<p>founded on the site of S. Clement's house, it is supposed, in the time
of Constantine. S. Jerome says: "The church built to S. Clement
keeps the memory of his name to this day." So that it must have
been erected before <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 400.</p>

<p>An inscription found in the excavations, bearing the name of Pope
Nicholas II., shows that this basilica was perfect in 1061, when
Nicholas died, so that it could not have been destroyed, as some
think, by the earthquake of 896; but it was ruined in 1084, when
Robert Guiscard burned all the public buildings from the Lateran to
the Capitol, when he came to the rescue of Pope Gregory VII.</p>

<p>The ruin seems to have been purposely filled in by the builders of
the upper church, and all the fittings possible removed into the latter,
which, from the nature of its walls, was evidently constructed in haste,
and before 1099, as Paschal II. was elected pope there on August 13th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
of that year. The lower church was discovered in 1857, when Father
Mullooly was making some repairs in the church above. It consists
of a nave and two aisles, formed by a line of ancient columns of
various marbles: the space between each column has been built up to
support the foundations of the church above.</p>

<p>In descending, the walls are covered with ancient fragments, and
a small statue of the Good Pastor, found in making the excavations;
as also the two sarcophagi and other fragments in the portico of
the ancient basilica. At the entrance, on the left hand, is a painting
of an ancient female figure, and a male head on the opposite wall;
a little further, on the left, Christ surrounded with Saints, giving his
benediction in the Greek manner; opposite, the Miracle at the Tomb
of S. Clement at Cherson.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

columns are of beautiful marbles, and stand upon a wall of the
imperial period, which has been traced for 98 feet.</p>

<p>At the west end of the north aisle a flight of narrow steps leads
down to a passage, 25 inches wide, formed between massive walls:
that on the right is brick of the imperial period, forming the wall of
S. Clement's house; that on the left, tufa, of the kingly period, being
part of the walls of Servius Tullius. This has been heightened by a
travertine wall of the republican period. The tufa wall has been
traced for 500 feet, and the travertine wall upon it for 410 feet.
About 20 feet is still buried, showing how low ancient Rome was in
this valley. At the end of this passage another flight of steps leads
up into the south aisle. In the centre of the passage is an entrance
through the imperial wall (now blocked up on account of the water)
into</p>

<h4>THE ORATORY OF S. CLEMENT,</h4>

<p>reached from the south aisle by a broad flight of twenty steps.
The Roman Catholic Church has faithfully handed down the tradition
that S. Clement erected an oratory in his own house, between
the C&oelig;lian and Esquiline Hills, which must have been built, as we
have seen, close to the walls of the city&mdash;a not unusual thing as the
city grew. Several chambers remain to be excavated at some future
time. A long passage has been cleared out, in which was found a
doorway bricked up. This was broken through, and found to be a</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF MITHRAS,</h4>

<p>the Persian sun-god, whose mysteries, Plutarch tells us, were first
brought to Rome by the soldiers of Pompey the Great. "They
celebrated certain secret mysteries, among which those of Mithras
continue to this day, being originally instituted by them <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 67."
This worship was finally extirpated in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 394. The temple was
found filled up with earth as though done purposely. It is 30 by 20
feet, and has a vaulted roof, covered with mosaics, in which are
several windows. The continual dripping of water has destroyed the
colour, but the mosaics can still be distinctly seen. The altar on
which the sacrifices were made was found near the two square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
pilasters in the passage outside, and a statue of Mithras was found
in three pieces. The altar has been placed within the temple. It
represents an allegorical picture of the sun's influence upon the earth:
A bull represents the earth; Mithras is plunging a sword into the
bull's right shoulder; a dog and a serpent are emblems of animals
nourished by the earth through the influence of the sun; a scorpion
gnawing the scrotum is autumn bringing decay; youths with torches,
erect and depressed on either side, represent the rising and the
setting of the sun. Under Elagabalus (218&ndash;22) and Aurelian (270&ndash;75)
the worship of the sun was the national religion of the Romans, and
its votaries tried in vain to establish it, to resist the rapid spread of
the worship of the only true God through Jesus Christ his Son.</p>

<p><i>From S. Clement's we proceed up the hill Via di S. Giovanni in
Laterano.</i> Near the top, on the right, is the villa of Mr. Warrington
Wood, the English sculptor, in whose grounds there is a tomb of the
republic. Beyond is the square of the Lateran, in which is the

<h4>EGYPTIAN OBELISK</h4>

<p>in Rome, which the inscription informs us was thirty-six years in
cutting.</p>

<p>From Marcellinus (xvii. 4), we get many interesting details of its
voyage and erection:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And because the flatterers, who were continually whispering into
the ear of Constantine, kept always affirming that when Augustus
Octavianus had brought two obelisks from Heliopolis, a city of
Egypt, one of which was placed in the Circus Maximus, and the
other in the Campus Martius, he yet did not venture to touch or
move this one, which has just been brought to Rome, being alarmed
at the greatness of such a task,&mdash;I would have those who do not
know the truth learn that the ancient emperor, though he moved
several obelisks, left this one untouched because it was especially
dedicated to the sun-god, and was set up within the precincts of his
magnificent temple, which it was impious to profane, and of which
it was the most conspicuous ornament.</p>

<p>"But Constantine deeming that a consideration of no importance,
had it torn up from its place, and thinking rightly that he should
not be offering any insult to religion if he removed a splendid work
from some other temple to dedicate it to the gods at Rome, which is
the temple of the whole world, he let it lie on the ground for some
time while arrangements for its removal were being prepared. And
when it had been carried down the Nile, and landed at Alexandria,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
a ship of burden hitherto unexampled, requiring three
hundred rowers to propel it, was built to receive it.</p>

<p>"And when these preparations were made, and after the aforenamed
emperor had died, the enterprise began to cool. However,
after a time it was at last put on board ship, and conveyed over sea
and up the stream of the Tiber, which seemed as it were frightened
lest its own winding waters should hardly be equal to conveying a
present from the almost unknown Nile to the walls which itself
cherished. At last the obelisk reached the village of Alexandria,
three miles from the city, and then it was placed in a cradle, and
drawn slowly on, and brought through the Ostia gate and the
public fish-market to the Circus Maximus.</p>

<p>"The only work remaining to be done was to raise it, which was
generally believed to be hardly if at all practicable. And vast
beams having been raised on end in a most dangerous manner, so
that they looked like a grove of machines, long ropes of huge size
were fastened to them, darkening the very sky with their density,
as they formed a web of innumerable threads; and into them the
great stone itself, covered over as it was with elements of writing,
was bound, and gradually raised into the empty air, and long suspended,
many thousands of men turning it round and round like a
millstone, till it was at last placed in the middle of the square.
On it was placed a brazen sphere, made brighter with plates of gold;
and as that was immediately afterwards struck by lightning and
destroyed, a brazen figure like a torch was placed on it, also plated
with gold, to look as if the torch were fully lighted.</p>

<p>"But the writing which is engraven on the old obelisk in the
Circus we have set forth below in Greek characters, following in this
the work of Hermapion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">

</div>

<p>"The first line, beginning on the south side, bears this interpretation:&mdash;'The
Sun to Ramestes the King&mdash;I have given to thee to
reign with joy over the whole earth; to thee whom the Sun and
Apollo love; to thee, the mighty truth-loving son of Heron, the
god-born ruler of the habitable earth, whom the Sun has chosen above
all men, the valiant, warlike King Ramestes, under whose power, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
his valour and might, the whole world is placed. The King
Ramestes, the immortal son of the Sun.'</p>

<p>"The second line is:&mdash;'The mighty Apollo, who takes his stand
upon truth, the lord of the diadem, he who has honoured Egypt
by becoming its master, adorning Heliopolis, and having created the
rest of the world, and having greatly honoured the gods who have
their shrines in the city of the Sun, whom the Sun loves.'</p>

<p>"The third line:&mdash;'The mighty Apollo, the all-brilliant son of the
Sun, whom the Sun chose above all others, and to whom the valiant
Mars gave gifts. Thou whose good fortune abideth for ever; thou
whom Ammon loves; thou who hast filled the temple of the Ph&oelig;nix

Apollo, the mighty son of Heron; Ramestes, the king of the world,
who has defended Egypt, having subdued the foreign enemy; whom
the Sun loves; to whom the gods have given long life&mdash;the master
of the world&mdash;the immortal Ramestes.'</p>

<p>"Another second line:&mdash;'The Sun, the great God, the master of
heaven. I have given unto thee a life free from satiety. Apollo,
the mighty master of the diadem; to whom nothing is comparable;
to whom the lord of Egypt has erected many statues in this kingdom,
and has made the city of Heliopolis as brilliant as the Sun
himself, the master of heaven,&mdash;the son of the Sun, the king living
for ever, has co-operated in the completion of this work.'</p>

<p>"A third line:&mdash;'I, the Sun, the god, the master of heaven, have
given to Ramestes the king might and authority over all; whom
Apollo, the truth-lover, the master of time, and Vulcan, the father
of the gods, hath chosen above others by reason of his courage; the
all-rejoicing king, the son of the Sun, and beloved by the Sun.'</p>

<p>"The first line looking towards the east:&mdash;'The great god of Heliopolis,
the mighty Apollo, who dwelleth in Heaven, the son of Heron,
whom the Sun hath guided, whom the gods have honoured. He who
ruleth over all the earth, whom the Sun hath chosen before all others.
The king, valiant by the favour of Mars, whom Ammon loveth, and
the all-shining god, who hath chosen him as a king for everlasting.'"</p>

<p><i>On our right of the obelisk is</i></p>

<h4>THE BAPTISTERY,</h4>

<p>said to have been erected by Constantine. Eight columns of
porphyry support a cornice, upon which are eight smaller columns;
these sustain the cupola. The font is of green basalt. A tradition
says Constantine was baptized here, though Socrates says he received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Christian baptism at Nicomedia just before his death. Gibbon says
Rienzi bathed in the font on the night before he was made a knight.
The two side chapels, dedicated respectively to John the Baptist and
John the Evangelist, are said to have been made out of the house of
Constantine. The mosaics are of the fifth century, after the arabesque
paintings in the Baths of Titus. <i>Adjoining</i> is the Oratory
of S. Venantius, in which is a mosaic of the seventh century&mdash;our
Saviour in the act of giving his blessing. Two grand porphyry
columns, supporting an entablature, formed the portico of the
baptistery, opposite side to where we entered. There is a mosaic vault
of the sixteenth century in the left chapel of this portico, and in the
opposite one a good S. Philip Neri by Guido.</p>

<p><i>On our left of the obelisk is</i></p>

<h4>THE LATERAN PALACE.</h4>

<p>From the time of Constantine to 1377 this was the palace of the
popes. In 1843 Gregory XVI. founded the museum. The original
palace was destroyed by fire in the time of Clement V., and the present
pile was built from the designs of Fontana in the pontificate of
Sixtus V. It was subsequently used for many years as an hospital.</p>

known as the 'Asarotos &OElig;cos,' from the fact that he there represented,
in small squares of different colours, the remnants of a banquet

<h4>S. GIOVANNI IN LATERANO.</h4>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
"The mother and head of the churches of the city and of the world."</p>
</div>

<p>This church was founded by Constantine, and took the name of
<i>Lateran</i> from its occupying the site of the Palace of Plautus Lateranus,
the senator, who suffered under Nero. After having existed for ten
centuries, it was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1308. It was
rebuilt by Clement V., and embellished by other popes. Clement XII.
had the façade executed from the design of Galilei. It is of travertine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
with four large columns and six pilasters of the Composite order,
which support a cornice surmounted by a balustrade, on which are
placed colossal statues of Jesus and several saints. Between the
columns and the pilasters there are five balconies; that in the
middle was used for the papal benedictions. Beneath the balconies
are as many entrances, which lead into the magnificent covered
portico (<i>loggiato</i>), decorated with twenty-four pilasters of the Composite
order. In this portico is placed the colossal statue of Constantine
found in his baths. Notice the beautiful bronze doors which
came from the Senate House in the Forum.</p>

<p><i>The interior</i> is divided into a nave and two aisles by four ranges
of pilasters. The architect was Borromini, who covered the ancient
columns which divide the middle aisles from the side ones with
pilasters, forming five arches, corresponding to an equal number of
chapels. Each of these pilasters is decorated, on the side of the
middle aisle, by two fluted pilasters, supporting a cornice which goes
round the church. Between these there are twelve niches, each
ornamented by two columns of verd-antique, containing the statues
of the apostles. The Corsini chapel, <i>first chapel on left of front entry</i>,
is one of the richest in Rome. It was executed by Clement XII.
from the design of Galilei, in honour of S. Andrew Corsini. The
porphyry sarcophagus of Clement XII. was brought from the portico
of the Pantheon, and is supposed to have contained the remains of
Agrippa. The subterranean chapel contains the remains of the
Corsini family. On the altar is the beautiful statue "Piety," said to
be by Bernini or Montanti.</p>

<p>This splendid church contains many chapels, decorated with
paintings and statues worthy of attention. On the second pier of
the right aisle is Giotto's Boniface VIII.</p>

<p>The Gothic Tabernacle above the high altar, containing the heads
of Paul and Peter, is a fine piece of workmanship of the fourteenth
century, restored by Pius IX. In front of the Confession is a bronze
tomb of Martin V., by Simone, Donatello's brother. Since 1876 the
transepts and the apse have been closed to the public; but on
Ascension day 1886, with grand religious ceremonies, they were
again thrown open to public view, <i>having been restored</i>. The frescoes
in the transept, representing scenes in the life of Constantine by artists
of the seventeenth century, have been touched up; the gold work
has been regilded, and the appearance of newness has been imparted
to the whole. At the end of the right transept, looking towards the
tribunal, is the grand organ and a banner captured from the Saracens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
The left transept contains the altar of the Sacrament by Paolo
Olivieri, the four gilt bronze columns being, it is said, from the
Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, made by Augustus out of the beaks
of the fleet of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Above the altar is the
finest fresco in the basilica, the Ascension by Arpino, 1600. To the
right is the Colonna chapel. The altar-piece is by Arpino, the roof
by Croce, whilst the portrait of Martin V. is by S. Gaetano. In the
recent restorations the old choir, tribunal, and the corridor of Leo I.,
440&ndash;61, which surrounded it, have been destroyed, and a new one
erected sixty-seven feet longer than the old one&mdash;a very unnecessary
piece of work and vandalism. The church was quite large enough
for any ceremonies that take place in it. The whole praise of <i>this
restoration</i> is claimed by Leo XIII.; but it is only just to Pius IX.
to record that he initiated and left money to continue the work,
although he is ignored in the laudations. In the four corners, above
the spring of the arches, are doctors of the Eastern and Roman
Churches&mdash;Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, and Anastasius. On
the left, above organ, the Commission submitting the Plans to Leo
XIII.; on the right, Innocent III. approving the Doctrine of Transubstantiation
(1215)&mdash;both the work of Francesco Grandi. The
mosaic on the vault of the apse belonged to the old apse, and has
been considerably <i>restored</i> in moving it from one to the other. It is
the work of Jacopo da Turrita and Gaddo Gaddi (1292). At the top
is the Almighty's head surrounded by angels; from the Father proceeds
the Holy Spirit (a dove) to the Cross (which represents the Son)
erected on the mountain from which flow the four rivers of paradise
round the heavenly Jerusalem, the gates of which are guarded by an
angel. Two harts and sheep drink of the waters; saints are on either
side; the Virgin has her hand on the head of Nicholas IV., who had
the mosaic done. The apostles below, between the windows, are by
Jacopo di Camerino, of the same period. The base of the tribunal is
inlaid marble imitation cosimati work of the thirteenth century, as
is also the Bishop's Throne, reached by a flight of steps. The Bishop
of Rome takes his title from S. John's Lateran, hence this church has
precedence over all others. The Bishop of Rome is by right thereof
Papa, Pope, or Father of the Roman Church. Since the death of
the last bishop, Pius IX., February 20, 1878, the chair has been
vacant; for some fanciful reason Leo XIII. has never taken possession
of his bishopric.</p>

<p><i>The Cloisters</i> of the twelfth century are interesting, and contain
many curious architectural remains.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Pope Leo XIII. intends to establish in the Lateran Palace a university,
under Cardinal Mazzella, for the scientific and literary study
of the clergy.</p>

<p><i>Passing out into the piazza at the front, on the right are</i></p>

<h4>THE GATES,</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Porta S. Giovanni</span>, opening on to the Via Nova Appia, <i>and near
by, to the right</i>, the walled-up ancient <span class="smcap">Porta Asinaria</span>, <i>best seen
from the outside</i>, through which Belisarius entered Rome, and which
the Isaurian guard betrayed to Totila, December 17, 546. The open
we are now rambling over was anciently called the Mirror. <i>On the
left</i> is the end wall of the dining-hall of the ancient Palace of the
Lateran, on which is a copy of an ancient mosaic of the time of Leo
III. <i>In a building behind this is the</i> <span class="smcap">Scala Santa</span>.</p>

<h4>BARRACKS OF THE EQUITES SINGULARES.</h4>

<p>On the right of the Scala Santa, parallel with the Via Tasso, the
Barracks of the Equites Singulares, or Horse Guards of the Emperors,
of the time of Hadrian, were discovered in March 1886. A noble
hall 90 feet long, containing many inscriptions, raised by the discharged
veterans, was discovered; also fragments of statues, and one
nearly perfect of the youthful Bacchus, a work that we may class
with the school of Praxiteles.</p>

<h4>THE SCALA SANTA</h4>

<p>consists of twenty-eight marble steps, which, it is supposed, our
Lord came down after his mock coronation in the judgment-hall of
Pilate. The blood from his bleeding brow marked certain of the
steps, and these are kissed by the ascending faithful, the knees of
whom so wore away the marble that it is now covered with a wooden
staircase, in which through slits the marble is seen. They are
said to have been brought from Jerusalem (where it formed the
stairs to Pilate's house) by the mother of Constantine. By ascending
these stairs on the knees, a thousand years' indulgence is secured to
those who believe it. Dickens said, "The sight was ridiculous in
the absurd incidents inseparable from it&mdash;to see one man with an
umbrella unlawfully hoist himself with it from stair to stair, and a demure
old lady of fifty-five, looking back every now and then to assure
herself that her legs were properly disposed." On the feast of the Assumption,
the sacred picture "Acheirotopeton" (made without hands)
is exposed to view. This picture is said to have been drawn in outline

by S. Luke, and before he commenced to fill the colours in, it was
found finished by invisible hands.</p>

<p>From the front of the church a charming prospect of the Campagna
is obtained.</p>

<p>To the right of the stairs is the Kiss of Judas; on the left, Ecce
Homo, by Giacometti. At the left of the hall, Christ Bound to
the Pillar, <i>opposite</i> Pius IX.</p>

<p>Martin Luther had made the ascent half-way, when he suddenly
stood up, turned about, and walked down. He said that a voice had
whispered to him, "The just shall live by faith." The Sancta
Sanctorum at the top is only open to the Pope, who alone can
officiate, and on the day before Palm Sunday to the canons of
the Lateran for adoration. The stairs can only be ascended on
the knees. <i>Behind is</i></p>

<h4>THE VILLA WOLKONSKY.</h4>

<p><i>Open on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Permission to be had at the
Russian Consulate, Piazza Feoli Corso.</i></p>

<p>The grounds are tastefully laid out, and are intersected by the
arches of Nero's aqueduct. From the roof of the casino, to which
the gardener will conduct you (fee, half a franc), a beautiful view may
be enjoyed at sunset, looking far away over the Campagna. In the
grounds is the columbaria of the family of T. Claudius Vitalis, an
architect.</p>

<p><i>Returning, first turning on the left</i>, passing over the open space
skirting under the walls, the curve is part of</p>

<h4>THE AMPHITHEATRUM CASTRENSE,</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Amphitheatre of the Camp</i>,)</p>

<p>of the time of Caligula, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 39, and incorporated by Aurelian into
his wall. It is of beautiful brickwork; the columns, of the Corinthian
order, are best seen from outside the wall. It was built near
the camp, that the soldiers might have their games without going
into the city and mixing with the people.</p>

<p>Suetonius ("Caligula," xxxi.) says, "He began an amphitheatre near
the septa or barracks of the soldiers." Dion Cassius records, "That
on one occasion, when the Emperor Caligula was in want of criminals
for combats, he seized a number of citizens, and after tearing out
their tongues that they might not complain, he had them brought
into the arena, where they were compelled to fight."</p>

<p><i>Adjoining is the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. CROCE IN GERUSALEMME,</h4>

<p>erected by S. Helena. The interior has three aisles divided by
pilasters, and with eight columns of Egyptian granite. The high
altar is adorned by four columns of breccia-corallina, which support
the canopy. Under the altar is an ancient urn, which contains the
bodies of the holy martyrs Anastasio and Cesario. The frescoes of
the vault of the tribune are by Pinturicchio. The subterranean
chapel of S. Helena is decorated with paintings by Pomarancio, and
with mosaics by B. Peruzzi. Ladies are not allowed to enter this
chapel, except on the saint's day. The church was erected in</p>

<h4>THE SESSORIUM PALACE,</h4>

<p>which was built by Sextus Varius, father of Elagabalus. This was
afterwards turned into the Palace of Helena, near which were her
baths, remains of which exist in the adjoining vineyards; also of the
reservoir; which remains are called by some the <span class="smcap">Temple of Venus
and Cupid</span>, from a statue found there. A Venus with Cupid at her
feet, supposed to be the likeness of Salustia Barbia Orbiana, the wife
of Alexander Severus, from an inscription on the pedestal saying
that it was dedicated to Venus by one Salustia.</p>

<p>In the "Excerpta Valesiana de Odac" (lxix.) it is mentioned as
"the palace called Sessorium." In the buildings at the <i>back</i> of the
church remains of a large palace can be traced. It is said by
tradition that it took its name from a basilica which stood here
where the cases of the slaves were tried. Another is, that here was
the Prætorium or headquarters of the Prætorian prefect of the city.
"It is said that Maximin, the prefect, had a small cord always suspended
from a remote window of the Prætorium, the end of which
had a loop which was easily drawn tight, by means of which he
received secret information" (Marcellinus, xxviii. 7). The ruin to
the left of the church has all the appearance of a basilica.</p>

<p><i>Returning past the Lateran, a lane by the side of Mr. Warrington Wood's,
via</i> <span class="smcap">S. Stefano Rotondo</span>, following the aqueduct, leads to the remarkable</p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. STEFANO ROTONDO,</h4>

<p>supposed to be formed from the remains of</p>

<h4>NERO'S MEAT-MARKET.</h4>

<p>A coin representing this market agrees with the architecture of
the church. "Then Nero celebrated a feast by way of thanksgiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
for his preservation, and dedicated the market-place where meat is
sold" (Dion Cassius).</p>

<p>The church is open all day on the 26th of December, being the
saint's day. <i>On other days, ring the bell at the door on the right.</i> It
is 133 feet in diameter. The outer circle consists of thirty-six
columns, and the inner of twenty. There was originally another
outer circle: this was destroyed, and the space between the columns
of the second circle, present outer, filled in to make the walls of the
church. In the centre two Corinthian columns support a cross wall.
The tabernacle contains the relics of S. Stephen. The frescoes by
Pomarancio on the walls, representing martyrdoms, are simply disgusting.
In the vestibule is an ancient episcopal chair, from which
S. Gregory read his fourth homily.</p>

<p><i>Left from the church, and left again, we enter the</i> <span class="smcap">Piazza di
Navicella.</span></p>

<p><i>In the piazza</i> is a small marble ship, placed here by Leo X., near
where it was found, this place having been the camp of the sailors.
<i>The church opposite is that of</i></p>

<h4>S. MARIA DELLA NAVICELLA,</h4>

<p>or S. Maria in Dominica, only open on the second Sunday in Lent.
It was restored by Leo X. from designs by Raphael. The Doric
portico is by Michael Angelo. It has eighteen fine columns of gray
granite. The mosaics in the tribune are of the ninth century.
The frieze over the windows of the nave is by Giulio Romano and
Pierino.</p>

<p><i>To the right of the church</i> are remains of the Monastery of</p>

<h4>S. TOMMASO IN FORMIS,</h4>

<p>founded by Innocent III. as the headquarters of the Trinitarians or
Redemptorists, whose mission was to rescue blacks and whites from
slavery. The mosaic by Cosmati, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1260, is the coat of arms of
the order. Just beyond is a Gothic arch, part of their buildings.
<i>Beyond this</i> the arch spanning the road is the</p>

<h4>ARCH OF DOLABELLA AND SILANUS.</h4>

<p>Built of travertine, and erected, as the inscription informs us, by
the above consuls, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 10. It was used by Nero to support the
aqueduct to his reservoir. Here is the hermitage of S. Giovanni
di Matha, 1213, who founded the Redemptorists.</p>

<p><i>Through the arch on the left is the entrance to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<h4>THE VILLA C&OElig;LIMONTANA,</h4>

<p>the residence of Baron Hoffmann, who kindly admits visitors on their
leaving their cards at the iron gate. Many fragments of antiquity
are spread about the grounds, from which there are some fine views.
Remains have been found of a Roman fire-station of the fifth cohort
of Vigili, whose names are on the pedestals dedicated by them to
Marcus Aurelius.</p>

<h4>THE OBELISK</h4>

<p>was erected by Duke Mattei, but only a very small part of it is
Egyptian. The fragment was found in making the present sloping
way up to the Capitol, and presented by the magistrates to the duke.
It is the only one not re-erected by a pope. It is said that when the
architect was directing its elevation, he forgot to take his hand off
the pedestal, and that the block was lowered on his hand, which was
amputated, the hand being left between the blocks.</p>

<p>At the corner of the grounds, towards the Baths of Caracalla, under
a medieval building, is the <span class="smcap">Fountain of Egeria</span>. (See <a href="#Page_275">page 275</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Opposite the entrance to the villa is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF SS. GIOVANNI E PAOLO,</h4>

<p>whence Cardinal Howard takes his title. It was erected in the fourth
century on the site where the martyrdom of the above saints took
place, by Pammachus, the friend of S. Jerome. They were officers of
Constantine's household, and were put to death by Julian. The medieval
portico is formed by eight marble and granite pillars. The aisles are
formed by sixteen ancient columns; the pavement is of <i>opus Alexandrinum</i>;
the stone surrounded by a railing is said to be that on which
the martyrs suffered death. The outside of the medieval apse is rare.</p>

<p><i>To the left of the church, and beneath the adjoining Passionist
Convent</i> (<i>ring at the door on the right</i>), are the remains of some solid
unfinished stone arches, supposed to be</p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF CLAUDIUS.</h4>

<p>Seutonius tells us that Vespasian erected the Temple "of Claudius
on the C&oelig;lian Mount which had been begun by Agrippina, but
almost entirely demolished by Nero."</p>

<p>Frontinus (xx. 76) tells us that the arches of Nero ended at the
Temple of Claudius. Now we have been following these arches for
some distance, and they end here.</p>

<p><i>Below the temple was</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<h4>THE VIVARIUM,</h4>

<p>or menagerie for the Colosseum. The arches have been laterally
closed, leaving small apertures of communication. The vivarium consists
of eight immense arches two stories high, formed from blocks of
travertine. The substructions occupy a large extent of the convent
gardens. A massive portion supports the elegant medieval
campanile, of the thirteenth century, one of the best preserved
in Rome. <i>Beneath this</i> are some subterranean chambers hewn
out of the tufa, supposed to be</p>

<h4>THE SPOLIARIUM,</h4>

<p>a prison for condemned gladiators. The younger Pliny says "it was
a cruel receptacle for those adjudged worthy of torture."</p>

<p>The gardens of the convent are built upon the top of</p>

<h4>THE RESERVOIR OF NERO.</h4>

<p>Suetonius tells us "he made a reservoir like unto a sea," which no
doubt was afterwards used to supply the Colosseum with water for
the naval combats. The quadrata of the C&oelig;lian is artificially
formed, and was evidently the great nymphæum connected with the
Golden House. The water was brought from the Claudian Aqueduct
at the Porta Maggiore upon arches, known as Nero's Arches,
which ended near the Temple of Claudius, and these arches end
in the gardens now supported by the walls forming the quadrata.
The niches and hemicyclia on the east side, with their channels of
supply behind, were evidently fountains, and the west side was probably
similar in character, some of the specuses still existing. The
front towards the Colosseum formed a grand cascade, the water falling
into the reservoirs, the ruins of which we see in advance of the
north wall of the quadrata, and at a lower level; from these it
poured into the great stagnum or lake below, now occupied by the
Colosseum. Signor Alberto Cassio found specuses all around the
top, and a euripus or channel at the base; and stalactites and <i>opus
signinum</i> can still be seen there.</p>

<p><i>Turning to the right</i> we pass under some medieval arches&mdash;flying
buttresses&mdash;to support the church. <i>On the left</i> are some remains of
the house of Gregory; and, <i>on the right</i>, the wood of the C&oelig;lian.
<i>This hill was the ancient Clivus Scauri. To the left</i> the steps lead
up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. GREGORIO,</h4>

<p>whence Cardinal Manning takes his title. It is built on the site of
the house of Gregory the Great, and was erected in the seventh
century. Its interior is embellished with sixteen granite columns.
The painting above the altar is by Sacchi, and the <i>predella</i> beneath
by Luca Signorelli. In a small side-chapel on the right is an ancient
marble chair, and in a glass case numerous relics of various saints
<i>Crossing the atrium</i>, in which is a monument to Sir Edward Carne,
envoy from Henry VIII., <i>we come to</i> the three detached chapels of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Silvia</span>, which contains a beautiful fresco of the Father, with
angels playing on instruments, by Guido Reni. It is built on the
site of the house of S. Gregory, remains of which can be seen
behind the chapel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Andrew</span>, containing the rival frescoes of Guido Reni and
Domenichino&mdash;S. Andrew adoring the cross on his way to execution,
and the Flagellation of S. Andrew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. Barbara</span>, containing the marble table on which S. Gregory
feasted every morning twelve poor pilgrims. On one occasion an
angel is said to have honoured them with his presence. The statue
of the saint was begun by Michael Angelo, and finished by his
pupil, Niccolo Cordieri.</p>

<p>Between the church and the chapels is a massive piece of tufa wall,
supposed to have been part of the fortifications of the C&oelig;lian Hill
when it was a separate fortress.</p>

<h4>MUSEO URBINO.</h4>

<p>In the wood in front of S. Gregorio, on the right going towards the
Arch of Constantine, is the new City Museum, containing many objects
of high historical interest arranged in chronological order.

<p class="center b12">ON THE HILLS, EAST.</p>

<h4>THE PINCIO.</h4>

<p><i>From the Piazza del Popolo, a sloping, winding road leads up to</i>
the favourite promenade of the Romans and Forestieri, who stroll
and drive here every day, and listen to a military band by which
the place is enlivened in the afternoons. <i>Ascending</i>, its terraces are
interspersed with fountains and statues, and there is a fine large bas-relief
on the wall opposite the two columnæ rostratæ adorned with
the prows of ships. The name of the hill is derived from the Pincii
family, whose estates were upon it towards the close of the empire. It
was formerly known as the Hill of Gardens, from those of Lucullus,
which passed to Valerius Asiaticus, and were coveted by Messalina.
It abounds in walks and shady nooks, interspersed with fountains
and the busts of Italia's great men. The side farthest from the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
overlooks the Villa Borghese. At the extreme corner is a fragment
of the old wall of Sylla&mdash;Muro Torto. From the terrace the scene
below, in the piazza, is quite a study:&mdash;beyond is the winding Tiber
and its round fortress of S. Angelo, the roof of the Pantheon, the
columns of Aurelius and Trajan, the Capitol and Milizie Towers, and
the Quirinal Palace; whilst between Monti Mario and the Janiculum
is the world's cathedral, with its vast dome towering high above all:
this dome is best seen at a distance, where the eye can embrace its
full proportions, for immediate proximity dwarfs its immensity.</p>

<p><i>In the centre of the grounds is</i></p>

<h4>THE EGYPTIAN OBELISK,</h4>

<p>which has on it the inscription <span class="smcap">Antoninus Osiris Oracle</span> (Utterer of
truth). It was brought by Hadrian from Egypt, and erected by
himself and his wife Sabina to his favourite Antinoüs, in the
Varianus Circus, amidst which ruins, near S. Croce in Gerusalemme,
outside the walls, it was found.</p>

<p><i>Passing out of the grounds by the road that runs parallel to the city,
on our left is</i></p>

<h4>THE FRENCH ACADEMY,</h4>

<p>or Villa Medici, <i>open every day from 8 till 12, and from 3 till dusk</i>.
The gardens are tastefully laid out, and several fine views may be
obtained from them. The <span class="smcap">Museum of Casts</span> (of statues not in
Rome) will repay a visit.</p>

<p><i>Proceeding up the avenue, just beyond, on the left, is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF TRINITA DEI MONTI,</h4>

<p>erected by Charles VIII. of France. Visitors should attend vespers
here, the nuns singing choral service; it commences half an hour
before Ave Maria. Over the altar of the side-chapel, in entering,
is a beautiful Descent from the Cross, the masterpiece of Daniele
da Volterra.</p>

<h4>THE EGYPTIAN OBELISK</h4>

<p>was found in the gardens of Sallust, and placed here by Pius VI.
in 1789. It is 48 feet high without the pedestal, and is supposed to
have been brought to Rome by Hadrian. It is thought by some to
be only a copy of the original in Egypt. Marcellinus says it stood in
the gardens of Sallust.</p>

<p>At No. 9 Piazza Trinità dei Monti, Poussin lived; and Zuccari
lived at 64 Via Sistina, close by. Beyond, the Via Cappo la Casa
runs out to the right: adjoining the Church of S. Giuseppe is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
New Museum of Industrial Art. Open every day from 9 till 3;
fee, 50 centesimi. <i>By the Via Sistina we reach the</i></p>

<h4>PIAZZA BARBERINI.</h4>

<p>It has in the centre a beautiful fountain, by Bernini, with four
dolphins supporting a shell, in which is a Triton; it throws water
to a great height. <i>Proceeding up the Via delle Quattro Fontane, on
the left is the</i></p>

<h4>BARBERINI GALLERY.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Palazzo Barberini.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Open every day from 12 till 4. Catalogues are lent for the use of
visitors.</i></p>

<p>It contains paintings by the first masters. The statue to Thorwaldsen,
in the garden, was lately erected by Mr. Wolff, Thorwaldsen's
pupil. The library is open from 9 till 2 on Thursdays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Room.</span>&mdash;Fresco on vault, Triumph of Glory, by Cortona;
16. Joseph and Potiphar's Wife, by Beliverti; 21. S. Cecilia, by
Lanfranco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;48. Madonna, by Francia; 63. His Daughter, by
Raphael Mengs; 74. Adam and Eve, by Domenichino.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Room.</span>&mdash;73. The Slave, by Palma Vecchio; 81. Portrait,
called the Stepmother of Beatrice Cenci (?) by Caravaggio; 82. The
Fornarina, by Raphael; 83. Lucrezia Cenci, the mother of Beatrice
Cenci (?), by Scipione Gaetani; 85. The so-called Beatrice Cenci, by
Guido. This is nothing more or less than Guido's model, and the
same face can be seen in the Aurora, and in the fresco at S.
Gregory's. It could not possibly be Beatrice, for Guido did not
come to Rome till sixteen years after her death. 86. Death of
Germanicus, by Poussin; 90. Holy Family, by Sarto.</p>

<p>The inscription on the right side of the palace records the campaign
of Claudius in Britain.</p>

<p><i>Proceeding up the</i> <span class="smcap">Quattro Fontane</span>, at the top of the hill are four
river gods acting as fountains. The church at the left corner of Via del
Quirinale is S. Carlo, its space being equal to the area of one of the piers
which supports the dome of S. Peter's. <i>Turning down this street</i>, the
church on the left is</p>

<h4>S. ANDREW'S,</h4>

<p>on the site of the Temple of Quirinus (Romulus). It contains the
tomb of Emanuele IV. of Sardinia, who abdicated in 1802, and
died a monk in 1818. The church is a little gem.</p>

<p><i>At the end of the street is the square</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<h4>MONTE CAVALLO.</h4>

<p>In the centre is a fountain, with granite basin 26 feet in diameter,
which formerly stood in the Forum; also two beautiful colossal horse-tamers
in marble, supposed to be Castor and Pollux by some, by
others, Alexander and Bucephalus. The Latin inscriptions state
one of these colossi to be the work of Phidias, the other of Praxiteles.
Both were presented to Nero by Tiridates, king of Armenia. They
once ornamented the Baths of Constantine, and have never been
buried. The whole is surmounted by an Egyptian obelisk found
near the Mausoleum of Augustus. <i>On the left</i> is the king's</p>

<h4>QUIRINAL PALACE.</h4>

<p>It numbers some splendid apartments, containing many works of
art; and the gardens are of considerable extent. It is the residence
of King Humbert, and is accessible to the public; but should the
royal family be at home, the private apartments are not shown; otherwise
it may be readily viewed on presenting your card at the entrance.
Guido Reni's beautiful picture of the Annunciation is in the small
private chapel, as also the frescoes of the life of the Virgin, by Albani.
The casino in the gardens is decorated with frescoes by Oritonti,
Battoni, and Paolini. The palace was founded by Gregory XIII.
in the year 1574, and completed by Clement X., several intermediate
popes having done much for its extension and embellishment,
notably Clement VIII. Urban VIII. enclosed and added the
present garden, and Gregory XVI. and Pius IX. made the palace
what it is&mdash;that is to say, one of the most sumptuous and attractive
palaces in Italy. Few of our readers will require to be informed
that the Quirinal was the place appointed for the conclave when
the new Pope was elected, and that Pope Pius IX. was the last
successor of S. Peter who was proclaimed from the balcony overhanging
the principal entrance.</p>

<p><i>On the left, beyond the fountain, within the high wall, is the</i></p>

<h4>ROSPIGLIOSI PALACE.</h4>

<p><i>Open on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 9 till 3; entrance upstairs
to left of gate.</i></p>

<p>It is celebrated for its casino, containing Guido Reni's Aurora; it also
contains many pictures, ancient sculptures, and fragments of frescoes,
from the Baths of Constantine, on a portion of the site of which it is
built. The principal paintings in the palace are:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Centre Room.</span>&mdash;Head of Christ, by Jesse; Vanity, by Titian;
Mater Doloroso, by Sassoferrato.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Left Room.</span>&mdash;Our Saviour Bearing the Cross, by Daniele da
Volterra; Head of Goliath, by Domenichino; the Deposition, a
sketch by Rubens; Perseus Rescuing Andromeda, by Guido Reni.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Right Room.</span>&mdash;Diana and Venus, by Lawrence Lotto; Adam
and Eve, by Domenichino; Samson's Death, by Caracci.</p>

<p><i>Opposite is the entrance to</i></p>

<h4>THE COLONNA GARDENS.</h4>

<p>They contain several antiques and remains of the cornice of
Aurelian's Temple of the Sun. Looking down a chasm, we see
remains of the Baths of Constantine. Under the cypress trees are
several sarcophagi, and the stem of the pine tree planted on the day
Rienzi died. There is also a fine piece of the tufa wall that made
the seven hills one city.</p>

<h4>THE CAPITOLIUM VETUS.</h4>

<p><i>To the right from the gardens, the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Quirinale</span> brings us to the
new Via Nazionale. Where this winds round is a piece of a wall of
the kings. Plutarch ("Numa," xiv.) and Solinus (i. 21) tell us that
Numa lived upon the Quirinal, where he built an arx (Hieron.
i. 298), called, after the Capitoline Hill was so named, <span class="smcap">Capitolium
Vetus</span>. In it was a temple to Jupiter (Varro, "L. L." v.; Martial,
v. 22). In those days a tongue jutted out here towards the Capitoline
Hill, and this piece of wall bars the way to it, so it is probably a
piece of the arx that defended the tongue.</p>

<p>The lofty brick tower is</p>

<h4>THE TORRE DELLE MILIZIE,</h4>

<p>within the precincts of the Convent of S. Catherina di Sienna,
supposed to have been built upon a cella formerly occupied by
Trajan's soldiers. This tower is called by the Roman <i>valets de
place</i> "Nero's Tower," from his having sat there and fiddled whilst
Rome was burning. Now, as this tower was built in 1210 by
Pandolfo della Suburra, the senator, it could not have been the tower
Nero fiddled on. Besides, Suetonius says, "This fire he [Nero]
beheld from a tower in the house of Mæcenas," which was on the
Esquiline, where remains have been recently found.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Via Panisperna</span>, to the left, descends into the valley between
the Quirinal and Viminal hills. In the valley <i>to the left</i> of the street is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. AGATA IN SUBURRA,</h4>

<p>where the heart of O'Connell is deposited. <i>Keeping straight on, up
the slope of the Viminal</i>, <span class="smcap">Via Panisperna</span>, at the top of the hill is</p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. LORENZO,</h4>

<p>who is said to have been martyred under Claudius II., <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 269,
having been cooked to death on a gridiron. Here are also the relics
of S. Crispin and S. Crispinian. The church is on the site of the
baths of the daughter-in-law of Constantine, Olympia. The two
seated statues, Menander and Posidippus, in the Vatican, were found
here, and were for a long time worshipped as saints.</p>

<p><i>Close by is the Church of</i> <span class="smcap">S. Lorenzo in Fonte</span>, said to be over
the site of the prison of S. Lawrence, and a fountain is shown where
he baptized his converts.</p>

<p><i>Descending</i> the slope of the Viminal, we strike the <span class="smcap">Via Urbana</span>,
on the line of the ancient <span class="smcap">Vicus Patricius</span>.</p>

<p><i>Proceeding up the Via Urbana, on the left is the</i></p>

<h4>HOUSE OF PUDENS.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>S. Pudenziana.</i>)</p>

<p>The church stands back from the street, with a handsome new
front, restored by Cardinal Buonaparte. Cardinal Wiseman was
titular cardinal of this church. <i>It is only open at a very early hour&mdash;on
May 19th all day, and on the third Tuesday in Lent. The custodian
is to be found at 161, next door to the church.</i> A flight of steps
leads down to the church. The door is formed with ancient spiral
columns, and eighth century Christian reliefs; above are some modern
frescoes of Peter, Pudens, Pudentiana, and Praxedes. There is
a picturesque campanile.</p>

<p>The present church was formed out of the great hall of the Baths
of Novatus after <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 108; the baths being erected in the time of
Domitian adjoining the house of Pudens, who founded in his house
a Christian oratory before <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 96. This oratory exists below the
present church, which was formed by Bishop Pius, who died in <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
157. The church below is the oldest Christian church in the world,
and existed in the time of S. Paul, who, writing to the Romans
(xvi. 13), says, "Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother
and mine." This Rufus was Aulus Rufus Pudens, who held an
official position in the southern province of Britain, and married
Gladys (Claudia), the daughter of Caractacus, the British chief. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
was likewise half-brother of S. Paul, and the friend of Martial the
poet. The apostle, writing to Timothy from Rome (2 Tim. iv. 21),
says, "Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia,
and all the brethren." Linus was the second son of Caractacus, and
was the first bishop of the Church of Rome ordained by Paul.</p>

<p>From Cyllinus, the eldest son of Caractacus, descended Constantine
the Great, born and bred, and proclaimed emperor, in Britain. Thus
the first Bishop of Rome and the first Christian emperor were
undoubtedly Britons of royal British blood.</p>

<p>In the tribune of the church is a beautiful mosaic of the time
of Adrian I., <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 772&ndash;795, who built the apse inside the wall
of the large hall. The old wall can be seen on the outside, the
mosaic representing our Saviour on a throne, with four of the
apostles on each side, and Pudentia and Praxedes behind; the
paintings above are by Pomarancio. In the left aisle is a well,
containing, it is said, remains of the martyrs&mdash;some remains are
shown. At the end of this aisle is the chapel of S. Peter; the
mosaic pavement belonged to the baths. On the left is a copy of
the inscription from the catacomb of S. Priscilla: "<span class="smcap">Bene Merenti
Corneliæ Pudenzianæ.</span>" Under the altar is a sponge said to have
been used by the two sisters to collect the blood of the martyrs.
Above is a relief, by Giacomo della Porta, of Peter receiving the
keys from Christ. On the left of this aisle opens the Chapel of the
Gaetani&mdash;rich in marbles. The roof is in mosaic, representing the
four Evangelists, and over the door are representations of the sisters
Pudentia and Praxedes collecting the blood of martyrs. They are
by Rossetto, designed by F. Zuccari (1600). The altar-piece, by
Paolo Olivieri, is the Adoration of the Magi. <i>For a more detailed
account of this interesting church, see our</i> "Footsteps of S. Paul
in Rome."</p>

<p>Retracing our way down the Via Urbana, we come to where the
Via di S. Lucia in Selci goes off at an angle to the left. Here was</p>

<h4>THE SCENE OF TULLIA'S IMPIETY.</h4>

<p>With our face towards the angle, it will be noticed that the Via
S. Lucia divides the Esquiline Hill into two spurs: that on our
<i>left</i> was called the <span class="smcap">Cispius</span>, that on our <i>right</i> the <span class="smcap">Oppius</span>. The Via
Leonina Suburra, at our back, was the ancient Vicus Cyprius; the
point of the angle being its summit; the Via S. Lucia was the Clivus
Urbius. Up this latter street, on the right, an ascent, the ancient
Clivus Pullius, leads to S. Martino a Monti. "Tarquinius Superbus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
lived on the Esquiline, above the Clivus Pullius, at the Fagutal
Grove." "Servius Tullius lived above the Clivus Urbius" (Solinus,
i. 25).</p>

<p>Having thus fixed the topography, we shall see how Livy's account
of the murder and impiety (i. 48) agrees with it. "Servius Tullius
had arrived at the top of the Vicus Cyprius, when he was overtaken
and slain by some sent after him by Tarquinius. Tullia, in returning
home from the Forum, had arrived at the top of the Vicus Cyprius,
where the Temple of Diana lately stood. She was just <i>turning to the
right</i> to ascend the Clivus Urbius, which led to the top of the Esquiline
Hill, when the charioteer stopped and showed her her father's dead
body lying across the street; but she bade him drive over the dead
body, and arrived home bespattered with her father's blood. From
this unnatural deed the name of the street was changed to Vicus
Sceleratus, the wicked street." (See Dionysius iv. 39.)</p>

<p><i>From here follow the Via Urbana, turn to the right up the</i> <span class="smcap">Via
S. Maria Maggiore</span> <i>to the church, which we enter at the back, and
pass through</i></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARIA MAGGIORE.</h4>

<p>In the foreground is an Egyptian obelisk 63 feet high. The church
was founded <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 352. It is 120 yards long by 50 wide. Its
columns are of the Ionic and Corinthian orders. The interior is of
three aisles, and has thirty-six Ionian columns of white marble, from
the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli. The high altar is formed of a large
urn of porphyry, covered by a slab of marble, which is supported by
four angels in gilt bronze. The canopy, erected by Benedict XIV.,
is supported by four columns of porphyry, surrounded by gilt palms.
The four angels in marble were sculptured by P. Bracci. Under the
high altar is the beautiful Confession, done by Vespignani, by order
of Pius IX., in 1863, in which is preserved the relic of the cradle of
the Saviour, and the bodies of S. Matthew and other saints. Here
the late Pope was to be buried; but he would not allow his successor to
ask leave of the Italian government, burial inside the walls being prohibited,
and in his will he directed that his body should be interred
in S. Lorenzo outside the walls. The monument is by Jacometti.</p>

<p>The mosaic pictures over the arches on each side are of the fifth
century&mdash;a long series of panels of Scripture subjects, the historical
books of the Old Testament.</p>

</div>

<p>The Arch of Triumph over the altar is of the same period. Those
on the vault of the tribune are of the thirteenth century. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
loggia, over the front entrance, is another very fine mosaic picture
of the fourteenth century. <i>On the left of the high altar is the</i></p>

<h4>BORGHESE CHAPEL.</h4>

<p>The altar-piece is of jasper; the painting of the Virgin and Child
is said to be by S. Luke. Above is the bronze bas-relief representing
the miracle of the snow which fell in August <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 352 upon the
exact space occupied by the basilica. The frescoes are by Guido,
Lanfranco, Arpino, and Cigoli.</p>

<p>The monuments of Paul V. and Clement VIII. are composed of
beautiful bas-reliefs representing scenes in their lives.</p>

<p><i>Opposite is the</i></p>

<h4>SIXTINE CHAPEL,</h4>

<p>erected by, and containing the tomb of, Sixtus V. It was lately
restored by Pius IX., who was to have had his temporary resting-place
here, behind the altar. The altar is a representation of the
tomb of our Saviour at Jerusalem, and is a splendid piece of
workmanship. Beneath it is preserved part of the manger. Opposite
the lower altar is a statue of S. Gaetano, by Bernini. The
frescoes of the dome, representing the hosts of heaven, are beautifully
executed by Podesti. The monument to Sixtus V. is by Valsoldo;
that to Paul V. by L. de Sarzana. The bas-reliefs represent
historical subjects of the two pontificates.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the church by the end opposite to that by which we entered</i>,
we find ourselves in the piazza, which contains a handsome column,
taken from the Basilica of Constantine by Paul V. It is surmounted by
a figure in bronze representing the Virgin. The column is forty-seven
feet high, without the base and capital. <i>On the left of the church is the</i></p>

<h4>COLUMN OF HENRY IV.</h4>

<p>In 1873 the column of an inverted cannon, which stood in front of
the Church of S. Antonio Abate, erected in 1596 to commemorate
the reconciliation of Henry IV. of France to Clement VIII., was
removed in altering the level of the road. At the time of its removal,
a majolica vase was discovered under the base, which on
being lately opened was found to contain a large brass medal, bearing
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
IN HONOREM PASSIONIS D. N. JESU CHRISTI ET B. V. MARIÆ AC S.<br />
ANTOINI ET OMNIUM SANCTORUM, REVERENDUS DOMINUS.</p>
</div>

<p>Carolus Anison Galeus, preceptor generalis preceptoriæ ejusdem S.
Antoini prope Albam, terram Petragoricensis Dioceseos et Vicarius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
in Prioratu S. Antoini de urbe suis propriis expensis posuit. Sedente
S<sup>mo</sup> domino nostro Clemente VIII. Pont. Opt. Max. anno domini
<span class="smcap">MDXCVI</span>.</p>

<p>The column has now been re-erected, but not inverted, on the east
side of S. Maria Maggiore, and the vase and its coin re-interred
beneath it.</p>

<p>It appears that Louis XIV. caused the original inscription on the
base of the column to be removed, and this has lately been found in
the convent of S. Antony, recording that the column was erected in
memory of the Christian absolution of Henry the Fourth of France
and Navarre.</p>

<p><i>In front of S. Maria Maggiore, on the right, Via S. Prassede, is</i></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. PRAXEDES,</h4>

<p>erected in 823 by Paschal I., and restored by Nicholas V. in 1450,
and more lately by Carlo Borromeo. The main entry from the Via
di S. Martino, consisting of the original portico, sustained by two
granite Ionic columns, is seldom open. The entrance in use is on
the side from the Via S. Praxedes. Sixteen granite columns, with
composite capitals, divide the nave from the aisles. Double flights
of steps of <i>rosso antico</i> lead up to the tribune. On each side of the
altar, over choir gallery, are remarkable columns of white marble, with
foliage ornaments. In the middle of the nave is a so-called well, in
which Praxedes is said to have collected the remains of martyrs.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Mosaics</span> are a striking feature of this church. They belong
to the time of Pope Paschal I., and, like those in S. Cecilia and S.
Maria in Navicella, are interesting as illustrating the low depth to
which this art had sunk in Rome at that period.</p>

<p>On the tribunal, our Lord stands on a mound, from which issues
the river of life, <span class="smcap">Jordanes</span>. On his left are S. Paul, S. Pudentiana,
and S. Zeno; on his right S. Peter, S. Praxedes, and Paschal, the
last carrying a model of the church which he built. He has a square
nimbus, which shows that he was alive when the mosaic was executed.
Beneath is a lamb with a nimbus, and with six sheep on
either side, representing Christ and his apostles; at the extremities,
Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Below is the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>This holy fabric shines decorated with varied metals in honour of
Praxedes, pleasing to our Lord above the heavens, by the care of the
Sovereign Pontiff Paschal, nursling of the apostolic chair; who, burying
many bodies of saints, puts them under these walls, that by the
benefit of their prayers he may merit to enter the gates of heaven.</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>The oil painting of Praxedes is by Maria Dominico Muratori of
Bologna. On the vault of the arch are flowers growing from two
pots, and in the centre the monogram of Paschal. On the face of
the tribunal are, in the centre of the arch, the Lamb, with three
candlesticks on one side and four on the other, allegorical of the
seven mysteries; on either side angels and the emblematical figures
of the four apostles; then the four and twenty elders casting down
their golden crowns, as at St. Paul's. These mosaics are evidently
copied from those at SS. Cosmo and Damiano. On the face of the
Arch of Triumph is the vision of S. John&mdash;our Saviour, with angels,
Pudentiana, Praxedes, and the apostles, within the walls of the
heavenly Jerusalem, the gates of which are guarded by angels.
Other angels approach leading groups of the faithful, below whom
are the martyrs with their palms. On the vault of this arch are
mosaics similar to those of the tribunal.</p>

<p>The sacristy in the right aisle contains a Crucifixion by the
Florentine artist Augustino Campelli, 1581, and a Flagellation by
Giulio Romano. The second chapel contains Christ Bearing the
Cross, by F. Zucchero, and on the roof the Ascension, Prophets and
Sibyls, by D'Arpino. The next chapel has pictures from the life of
Carlo Borromeo, and his chair and table. By the main door is a
slab of <i>nero-bianco</i> granite, on which S. Praxedes is said to have slept.
The second chapel on the right, coming up, contains the Eternal Father,
by Borgognone, and a Deposition, by Vecchi. The next is the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chapel of S. Zeno.</span> Two columns of rare gray porphyry support
the sculptured frieze of the doorway, above which are mosaics of
heads in two rows: top row, Christ and the Apostles; second row,
Virgin and Child, with members of the family of Pudens. Over the
altar is a piece of a column, in black and white marble, said to be
that to which Jesus was tied at his flagellation. The mosaic on the
roof represents the Saviour supported by four angels. Over the
altar is a Virgin and Infant, with Pudentiana and Praxedes. Opposite
is the Lamb on a Rock, from which flows a stream, with four
harts drinking. Opposite the entrance is S. John the Baptist and
the Virgin. On the left are SS. Agnes, Pudentiana, and Praxedes,
and over the door the throne of God, with SS. Peter and Paul. On
the right are James, Andrew, and John. Ladies are forbidden to
enter this chapel, under pain of excommunication, except on the first
Sunday in Lent, and on Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>The adjoining chapel contains the tomb of Cardinal Cetivej, 1474,
on which is his recumbent statue, with reliefs of Paul, Peter, Pudentiana,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
and Praxedes. The Flagellation is by Francesco Guidi. The
chapel at the end contains the reclining figure of the French Cardinal
Anchera, 1286; signed <i>Christianus Magister fecit</i>.</p>

<p>In the crypt, beneath the high altar, are some fourth century
Christian sarcophagi, said to contain Pudentiana, Praxedes, and
others; also a beautiful cosimati altar and a ninth century fresco of
the Madonna and Child.</p>

<p>The custodian will here tell you that there is a subterranean communication
between this crypt and the Catacombs, but that it is now
walled up. This passage exists only in his fertile imagination; the
Catacombs <i>do not</i> communicate with any of the churches in Rome.</p>

<p>The first floor of the tower contains remains of a fresco, time of
Paschal, illustrating the life of S. Anne.</p>

<p><i>The Via dello Statuto, on the right of the Via Merulana, contains</i></p>

<h4>A ROMAN VILLA,</h4>

<p>discovered on the right in forming this street in 1884&ndash;5. Considerable
remains of a nymphæum were found, and a beautiful ædicula,
with its statues <i>in situ</i>; from this some steps led down into a Mithraic
cave. As soon as the building going on here is finished, these
remains will be opened to the public.</p>

<h4>PRIMITIVE TOMBS.</h4>

<p>Not the least interesting discovery in this neighbourhood was that
of a number of primitive tombs formed with local stone, shaped like
the Campagna huts. It is curious that after upwards of two thousand
five hundred years of burial, the remains of the early inhabitants
of the Palatine, C&oelig;lian, and Quirinal hills, should be brought to light
on the Esquiline, which was the burial-ground till the days of Mæcenas,
and be another confirmation of the truth of early Roman history.</p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. MARTINO</h4>

<p>was erected by Symmachus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 500, on the site of the Church of S.
Silvester, in the time of Constantine. The nave is formed by twenty-four
ancient columns, said to have come from Hadrian's Villa. The
Confession, beneath the high altar, leads to the more ancient church
formed out of part of the Baths of Hadrian. It was here that the
Councils of <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 352&ndash;356 were held, when the acts of the Council of
Nicæa were condemned and burned. The landscape frescoes in the
upper church are by the brothers Poussin.</p>

<p><i>From here we can best visit (No. 10 up the lane, turn round to the left)</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SETTE SALE,</h4>

<p>which was a reservoir for the Colosseum. It consists of nine
parallel chambers, communicating with each other by arches placed
obliquely, to prevent the pressure of the water on the walls. Between
this and S. Maria Maggiore was found the Laocoon, now in
the Vatican, by Felix de Freddis, as we are informed by the inscription
on his tomb in the Church of Ara C&oelig;li. It was found in 1506,
in the same niche where Pliny tells us it was admired in his time.</p>

<p><i>Returning down the lane into the Via Merulana, turn right. Upon
our left were</i></p>

<h4>THE GARDENS OF MÆCENAS,</h4>

<p>which, we learn from various ancient authors, were situated on the
Esquiline. Horace, speaking of them, says: "Now it is possible to
live on the Esquiline, for it is a healthy spot, especially to wander on
the sunny agger." Suetonius, speaking of the great fire in Nero's
time: "This fire he [Nero] beheld from a tower in the house of Mæcenas
on the Esquiline." "Here was a common burying-place for wretched
paupers" (Horace). Hence it must have been outside the Wall or
agger of Servius Tullius, remains of which have been found on the
left-hand side of the road leading from S. Maria Maggiore to S.
Giovanni in Laterano. Close to this part, and inside the agger, a
chamber has been excavated, evidently</p>

<h4>THE AUDITORIUM,</h4>

<p>or lecture-hall of Mæcenas, the entrance being formed through the
agger. It is 24 metres 40 centimetres long, by 10 metres 60 centimetres
broad. The wall supporting the roof, in which was the
window, is nearly eight metres high. On each side of the hall the
walls contain six niches decorated in the Pompeian style. At
the farther end of the hall is a sort of tribune composed of seven
circular steps in tiers, once faced with marble. From here the
author recited. In the circular wall behind these, which forms
the end of the hall, are five more niches. The floor is below the
surrounding level, probably to keep the building cool during the
summer months. Its height was about forty feet.</p>

<p>It may be that in this auditorium Virgil read his "Georgics" to
Mæcenas, as he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I sing, Mæcenas, and I sing to thee....</p>
<p>O thou! the better part of my renown,</p>
<p>Inspire thy poet, and thy poem crown;</p>
<p>Without thee, nothing lofty can I sing."</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>Or Horace, his Odes recited to Mæcenas' praise,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"You that are both my shield and glory dear."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The auditorium now serves as a local museum. It is open every
Thursday from 9 till 11 and 3 till 5. <i>Permissions</i> must be obtained
at the Archæological Office at the Capitol.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Owing to the new quarter of Rome being built here, the
roads are very much cut up and changed in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Retracing our steps towards the Basilica, turn to the right up the</i> <span class="smcap">Via
S. Vito</span>. <i>At the corner</i> is the Gothic Church of the Holy Redeemer,
built by a Mr. Douglas, who went over to the Roman Church. <i>Up
the street is</i></p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF GALLIENUS,</h4>

<p>erected in 262 in honour of the emperor, by Marcus Aurelius Victor.
It is plain and unadorned, and only the central arch is preserved.</p>

<p><i>Passing under the arch, turn to the left</i>, there are some remains of
the agger. <i>Beyond, on the opposite side of the street, is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. ANTONIO ABBATE,</h4>

<p>where the animals are blessed on January 17th. The round doorway
is the only one of its sort in Rome.</p>

<p><i>To the right we reach the new Piazza Vittorio Emanuele. On our
left is</i></p>

<h4>THE NYMPHÆUM</h4>

<p>of Alexander Severus, called the Trophies of Marius. It derives this
appellation from the marble trophies formerly placed in the two side
niches, and thence transferred to the parapet of the flight of steps
leading up to the Capitol. This splendidly decorated reservoir was
the nymphæum of the Emperor Alexander Severus, and is represented
on a coin. It was to the Aqua Julia what the Trevi Fountain
was to the Aqua Virgo. A portion of the aqueduct which supplied
the water is still standing. <i>Just beyond are</i></p>

<h4>THE TOMBS OF MÆCENAS AND HORACE.</h4>

<p>The first consists of a sepulchre of rubble work in a circular form,
now surmounted by a cottage; the second, near it, is a stable, with
two columns in front. Horace was buried near Mæcenas. Suetonius
tells us: "He was interred, and lies buried on the skirts of
the Esquiline Hill, near the Tomb of Mæcenas."</p>

<p>These tombs were ruthlessly destroyed by the municipality in
1884. <i>From the square the road leads to some remains of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BATHS OF GALLIENUS,</h4>

<p>miscalled the Temple of Minerva Medica, from a statue of the goddess
discovered here. It is a circular building, 80 feet in diameter,
and its walls contain numerous niches for statues; it was surmounted
by a lofty cupola, which fell in a short time ago. This building was
no doubt the sudatorium of the baths of Gallienus, which stood in his
gardens and occupied this ground. In the fragments of chambers adjoining,
terra-cotta pipes for the supply of hot water may still be seen.</p>

<p><i>The road from here leads to</i></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. BIBIANA,</h4>

<p>built in commemoration of her martyrdom. At the early age of
eighteen, during the prefecture of Apronianus, she was first scourged,
and then stoned to death. The church contains eight antique
columns, and frescoes from the saint's life by Cortona and Ciampelli.
Her statue at the high altar is the work of Bernini, and is considered
to be his masterpiece. The <i>fête</i> of S. Bibiana is the S. Swithin's
day of the Romans, who have a saying that "if it rain on this day it
will continue to do so for the next forty." We are not superstitious,
but we cannot help wishing that the saint will smile upon us. The
Church of S. Bibiana was built in the fifth century, on the site of
the house where the virgin-martyr is believed to have lived. It was
in a great measure rebuilt by Pope Urban VII., and is only open on
the Friday after the fourth Sunday in Lent, and on the 2nd of
December, the anniversary of the saint.</p>

<p><i>Passing by the church, the road leads us through the new quarter of
the town. Passing the remains of a tower in the Agger, we turn to the
right, and pass the railway station through another section of the new
quarter. Behind the custom-house is a fine piece of the Agger and the
Porta Viminalis. Beyond, the barracks occupy the site of</i></p>

<h4>THE PRÆTORIAN CAMP,</h4>

<p>founded by Sejanus, the minister of Tiberius Cæsar, and destroyed
by Constantine. The walls consist of brickwork, and have corridors on
the inside, decorated with stucco and paintings. The camp was between
the Portæ Viminalis and Nomentana, and forms a square projection in
the present wall. It was outside the agger of Servius Tullius. The
north wall is of the time of Tiberius; the east was rebuilt in the fourth
century; the south has been reconstructed out of old square stones,
probably material taken from the west or city wall (which has never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
been found), or from fragments of the Agger of Servius Tullius. To
write the history of the Prætorian Camp would be equivalent to writing
the history of Rome from Tiberius to Constantine. Here murderers
were made emperors, and the empire put up to auction. Hence the
Prætorians sallied out to attack the citizens, who in their turn assailed
the camp. Here the guilty found asylum, and the innocent death.</p>

<p><i>Near the camp stood</i></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNA PRIMIGENIA.</h4>

<p>Its site is now occupied by the Piazza del Macao. Fragments of
the temple were found in August 1873, and an inscription to the
goddess; also the statue of a female member of the Claudian family.</p>

<p>"Quintus Marcius Ralla, constituted commissioner for the purpose,
dedicated the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia on the Quirinal Hill.
Publius Sempronius Sophus had vowed this temple ten years before,
in the Punic War, and, being afterwards censor, had employed persons
to build it," <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 558 (Livy, xxxiv. 53).</p>

<p><i>Returning past the station, we come to the open space of the</i></p>

<h4>PIAZZA DI TERMINI,</h4>

<p>a rather pleasant garden square, surrounded with trees, in the midst
of which spouts up the Aqua Marcia.</p>

<p><i>Passing along our right, we come to the</i></p>

<h4>BATHS OF DIOCLETIAN, AND CHURCH OF S. MARIA
DEGLI ANGELI.</h4>

<p>The magnificent bathing establishments, called Thermæ, to distinguish
them from the ordinary baths, consisted of a long series of
halls, chambers, and courts, all lying on the same level, so that the
extent of surface required for laying out had to be artificially formed
either by the removal or the elevation of the soil. The thermæ
founded by Diocletian and Maximian, and completed by Constantius
and Maximinus, constituted the largest edifice of this kind. At present,
only the great hall, 350 feet by 80 feet, and 96 feet high, converted
into a church by Michael Angelo, exists in a state of tolerable
preservation. The original massive granite pillars, 40 feet high,
and 5 feet in diameter, though so sunk into the ground (imitation
pedestals have been put to them) that their full height is nowhere
visible, are still standing; the antique vaulted roof has also been
preserved entire. This circumstance is of great importance for
the lighting up of this vast space&mdash;the masses of light falling upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
it at so favourable an angle, that the mind receives the same pleasing
impression at all hours of the day and at all seasons of the
year.</p>

<p>Several considerable portions of the adjoining hall are still to be
seen, but, being included within the buildings of the neighbouring
schools and asylums, and partly converted into hay magazines, a clear
and complete survey of them cannot easily be obtained.</p>

<p>The pictures in the church were brought from S. Peter's, and the
court of the monastery, formed with one hundred columns, was
designed by Michael Angelo. Salvator Rosa and Carlo Maratta were
both buried here. The Government is forming a new museum in
these buildings. On the right of the high altar is Domenichino's S.
Sebastian. <i>Opposite to it</i>, Maratta's Baptism of our Lord. The Presentation
in the Temple is by Romanelli; the Death of Ananias by
Roncalli. In the transept are copies of Guido's Crucifixion of S.
Peter, and Vanni's Fall of Simon Magus; S. Peter resuscitating
Tabitha, by Mancini; S. Jerome and S. Francis, by Musciano;
Assumption, by Bianchini; Resuscitation of Tabitha, by Costanzi;
Fall of Simon Magus, by Battoni; S. Basil celebrating Mass before
the Emperor Valens, by Subleyras.</p>

<p><i>On leaving the church, opposite</i> are the remains of the <span class="smcap">Theatridium</span>
belonging to the baths, the space in front being the Stadium.</p>

<h4>THE VIA NAZIONALE</h4>

<p>commences here, and runs down to the south end of the Corso. The
street is traversed by a line of tram-cars, which run down to the
Piazza di Venezia. It is the handsomest street in Rome, and is
lined by several fine blocks of buildings. It is on the line of the
ancient Vicus Longus. Upon the <i>right</i> is the Quirinal Hill; and on
the <i>left</i>, the Viminal; the street, artificially raised, occupying the
valley between the two hills. A short distance down on the left is
the Quirinal Hotel, the largest in Rome, fitted up with every modern
comfort, and on one of the healthiest sites in the city. Behind is
Costanzi's new theatre.</p>

<p><i>Just below is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. PAUL'S WITHIN THE WALLS,</h4>

<p>the new American Episcopal Church under Dr. Nevin; designed by
Mr. George Street in the Gothic style. It has a fine campanile, and
a beautiful peal of bells.</p>

<p>The vault of the tribunal in mosaic was designed by Mr. Burne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Jones, and represents Christ surrounded by the celestial company, as
described in Holy Writ.</p>

<h4>THE EXHIBITION OF FINE ARTS.</h4>

<p>The new Palace of Fine Arts is on the right, about half-way down.
In it is held an annual exhibition of modern works of art of every
description. Admission, one lira; Sundays, fifty centesimi. It
occupies a space of 22,030 square mètres&mdash;the permanent building
being 5,280 square mètres; the Crystal Hall, 1,250 square
mètres; the gardens, 5,000 square mètres; and the temporary
galleries, 10,500 square mètres. The palace comprises two floors,
and may be entered from the Via Nazionale, Via Genova, and
Via del Quirinale. The main front is 25 mètres high and 60 long.
Sixteen statues decorate the top of the façade, the work of Roman
artists.</p>

<p>On the top of the pediment is a group, Italy crowning Art, by
Adalberto Cencetti, the groups in relief on the face being the Finding
of the Laocoon Group, by Filippo Ferrari, and Carrying Cimabue's
Madonna in Triumph, by Puntoni.</p>

<p>Signor Pio Piacentini designed the edifice; and the works have
been carried out with the assistance of the architect Augusto Fallani,
at a cost of two and a half million lire.</p>

<p>On the façade of the entrance is the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE FELICE FOUNTAIN.</h4>

<p>The Acqua Felice aqueduct was made, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 1587, by Sixtus V.
(Felice Peretti), from whom it took its name. The fountain was
designed by Bresciano.</p>

<p><i>In the centre</i> of the group is seen Moses striking the rock, and the
water issuing forth; <i>on the left</i>, Aaron leading the Jews; and <i>on
the right</i>, Gideon bringing them to the brink of the stream. Four
lions guard the basins below. It is said that the work of the artist
was so criticised that he put an end to his life.</p>

<p><i>Turning down the Via Venti Settembre, on our right</i> is the <span class="smcap">New
Ministry of Finance</span>, in erecting which remains of the Porta
Collina in the Servian walls were found. Also remains of</p>

<h4>THE FLAVIAN TEMPLE,</h4>

<p>erected by Domitian on the site of his parents' house near the
<span class="smcap">Porta Collina</span>. A marble head of Titus was found in the
excavations.</p>

<p>"Whatever Domitian's unconquered hand has erected is imperishable
as heaven" (Martial, ix. 1). "What of the Flavian Temple
which towers to the Roman sky?" (<i>Ibid.</i>, ix. 3). The following is
amusing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Cæsar, on the Temple of the Flavian Family.</span>&mdash;Jupiter,
when he saw the Flavian temple rising under the sky of Rome,
laughed at the fabulous tomb erected to himself on Mount Ida;
and, having drunk abundantly of nectar at table, exclaimed, as he
was handing the cup to his son Mars, and addressing himself at the
same time to Apollo and Diana, with whom were seated Hercules
and the pious Arcos: 'You gave me a monument in Crete; see how
much better a thing it is to be a father of Cæsar!'" (Martial, ix. 34).</p>

<h4>THE UNFAITHFUL VESTAL'S TOMB.</h4>

<p>Livy (xxii. 57) tells us that this was "near the Colline Gate." We
learn from Pliny's "Letters" (iv. 11) that it was "a subterranean
cavern." Plutarch, in "Numa," gives the following interesting
details:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She that broke her vows of chastity was buried alive at the
Colline Gate. There, within the walls, is raised a little mound of
earth, called in Latin <i>agger</i>; near which is prepared a small cell,
with steps to descend into it. In this cell are placed a bed, a lighted
lamp, and some slight provisions, such as bread, water, milk, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
oil, as they thought it impious to take off a person consecrated with
the most awful ceremonies by such a death as that of famine. The
criminal is carried to punishment through the Forum in a litter
well covered without, and bound up in such a manner that her cries
cannot be heard. The people silently make way for the litter, and
follow it with marks of extreme sorrow and dejection. There is no
spectacle more dreadful than this, nor any day which the city passes
in a more melancholy manner. When the litter comes to the place
appointed, the officers loose the cords; the high priest, with hands
lifted toward heaven, offers up some private prayers just before the
fatal minute, then takes out the prisoner, who is covered with a veil,
and places her on the steps which lead down to the cell. After this,
he retires with the rest of the priests; and when she has gone down,
the steps are taken away, and the cell is covered with earth, so that
the place is made level with the rest of the mound. Thus were the
vestals punished who preserved not their chastity."</p>

<p>The remains of the Colline Gate were found in building the present
Ministry of Finance in the Via Venti Settembre. <i>The Via Servio
Tullio, on the left, leads to the site of</i></p>

<h4>THE VILLA SALLUSTIANA,</h4>

<p>upon the site of which a new quarter is being erected. Clear of the
houses is an interesting ruin miscalled the Temple of Venus Erycina.</p>

<p>This ruin is octagonal in form, with a domed roof. The interior
is divided into halls, and a vestibule leads into the central hall. The
walls have recesses for sculpture. The building was probably a
nymphæum.</p>

<p>Besides the palace, baths, and gardens, there was a portico, called
Milliarensis, from its thousand columns, in which the Emperor Aurelian
used to take exercise on horseback. The buildings were fired
by the soldiers of Alaric, who entered the city at the Salarian gate.</p>

<p><i>From the Piazza S. Bernardo we take the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Susanna</span> <i>into the</i>
<span class="smcap">Via S. Niccolo da Tolentino</span>. <i>The first turning on the right</i>,
<span class="smcap">Vicolo Fiamme</span>, <i>leads into the</i> <span class="smcap">Via di S. Basilio</span>, <i>which leads to the</i></p>

<h4>LUDOVISI MUSEUM.</h4>

<p><i>Open every day from 12 till 4, with permission to be had at the
consuls or bankers.</i></p>

<p>The beautiful villa has been cut up into building plots, and a new
quarter now occupies its site.</p>

<p>On the left of the entry is the Museum. The principal objects are&mdash;1.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Hercules. 4. Pan and Olympus. 11. Venus. 14. The Labours
of Hercules. 34. A fine mask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Room.</span>&mdash;Group of Mars and Cupid, found in the portico of
Octavia. 7. Theseus and Æthra, by Menelaos. 9. Satyr. 17. Julius
Cæsar. 28. Gallic group, of which the wounded Gaul in the Capitol
Museum formed a part. 41. Juno, the finest head of the goddess
known. 43. Pluto carrying off Proserpine.</p>

<p>Towards the Porta Pinciana is the casino containing Guercino's
beautiful fresco of Aurora driving away Night. A beautiful view is
to be had here.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the Museum, we pass down the Basilio into the Piazza Barberini.
On the right, up under the trees, are</i></p>

<h4>THE CHURCH AND CEMETERY OF THE CAPPUCCINI.</h4>

<p>In the first chapel on the right in the church is Guido Reni's beautiful
picture of S. Michael, and in the third chapel two pictures by
Domenichino. But the most interesting part, the cemetery, is beneath
the church, though entirely above ground, and lighted by a
row of iron-grated windows without glass. "A corridor runs along
beside these windows, and gives access to three or four vaulted recesses,
or chapels, of considerable breadth and height, the floor of
which consists of consecrated earth from Jerusalem. It is smoothed
decorously over the deceased brethren of the convent, and is kept
quite free from grass or weeds, such as would grow even in these
gloomy recesses if pains were not bestowed to root them up. But as
the cemetery is small, and it is a precious privilege to sleep in holy
ground, the brotherhood are immemorially accustomed, when one of
their number dies, to take the longest-buried skeleton out of the
oldest grave, and lay the new slumberer there instead. Thus each
of the good friars, in his turn, enjoys the luxury of a consecrated bed,
attended with the slight drawback of being forced to get up long before
daybreak, as it were, and make room for another lodger. The
arrangement of the unearthed skeletons is what makes the special
interest of the cemetery. The arched and vaulted walls of the burial
recesses are supported by massive pillars and pilasters made of thigh-bones
and skulls; the whole material of the structure appears to be
of a similar kind, and the knobs and embossed ornaments of this
strange architecture are represented by the joints of the spine, and
the more delicate tracery of the smaller bones of the human frame.
The summits of the arches are adorned with entire skeletons, looking
as if they were wrought most skilfully in bas-relief. There is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
possibility of describing how ugly and grotesque is the effect, combined
with a certain artistic merit, nor how much perverted ingenuity
has been shown in this queer way; nor what a multitude of dead
monks, through how many hundred years, must have contributed
their bony framework to build up these great arches of mortality.
On some of the skulls there are inscriptions, purporting that such a
monk, who formerly made use of that particular head-piece, died on
such a day and year; but vastly the greater number are piled up undistinguishably
into the architectural design like the many deaths
that make up the one glory of a victory. In the side walls of the
vaults are niches where skeleton monks sit or stand, clad in the brown
habits that they wore in life, and labelled with their names and the
dates of their decease. Their skulls (some quite bare, and others still
covered with yellow skin and the hair that has known the earth-damps)
look out from beneath their hoods, grinning hideously repulsive.
One reverend father has his mouth wide open, as if he had
died in the midst of a howl of terror and remorse, which perhaps is
even now screeching through eternity. As a general thing, however,
these frocked and hooded skeletons seem to take a more cheerful
view of their position, and try with ghastly smiles to turn it into a
jest. There is no disagreeable scent, such as might be expected
from the decay of so many holy persons, in whatever odour of sanctity
they may have taken their departure. The same number of living
monks would not smell half so unexceptionably." Hawthorne gives
this graphic description.

<p class="center b12">THE APPIAN WAY.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="center">"The Queen of Roads."&mdash;<i>Statius.</i></p>

<p>The Appian Way was the great southern road from Rome. It
led through Capua to Brundusium, which then as now was the port
for the East. It was first made as a regular roadway in <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 312.
"The censorship of Appius Claudius and Caius Plautius for this year
(<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 441) was remarkable; but the name of Appius has been
handed down with more celebrity to posterity on account of his
having made the road, called after him the Appian" (Livy, ix. 28).
But a road existed here before this, for at least part of the way,
evidently to Capua (<span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 414). "They came in hostile array to the
eighth stone on the road which is now the Appian" (Livy, vii. 39).</p>

<p>Statius gives some particulars as to how it was made. "First they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
cut two parallel furrows to indicate the width of the road, and then
they cut down between those until they came to the hard bottom,
and then began the levelling. As the construction proceeded, the
road assumed a slightly convex shape. The middle or top was called
the <i>dorsum</i>, or back-bone of the way; or, as it is called in Virgil,
"in aggere viæ." Roads that were left in the rough material were
said to be <i>munitæ</i>, but when covered with cut polygonal blocks they
were called <i>stratæ viæ</i>."</p>

<p>Procopius, the secretary of Belisarius in the sixth century, thus
describes the Appian Way:&mdash;"To traverse the Appian Way is a distance
of five days' journey for a good walker; it leads from Rome to
Capua. Its breadth is such that two chariots may meet upon it and
pass each other without interruption; and its magnificence surpasses
that of all other roads. In constructing this great work, Appius caused
the materials to be brought from a great distance, so as to have all
the stones hard, and of the nature of mill-stones, such as are not to
be found in this part of the country. Having ordered this material
to be smoothed and polished, the stones were cut in corresponding
angles, so as to bite together in jointures without the intervention
of copper or any other material to bind them; and in this manner
they were so firmly united, that on looking at them we would say
they had not been put together by art, but had grown so upon the
spot. And, notwithstanding the wearing of so many ages, being
traversed daily by a multitude of vehicles and all sorts of cattle,
they still remain unmoved; nor can the least trace of ruin or waste
be observed upon these stones, neither do they appear to have lost
any of their beautiful polish. And such is the Appian Way."</p>

<p>The road was lined with temples, villas, and tombs; for it was the
custom of the Romans to bury their dead on either side of the principal
roads leading from the city. It was against the law to bury inside the
walls, which was seldom permitted, and then only as a great honour.</p>

<p>"When thou hast gone out of the Capena Gate, and beholdest the
sepulchres of the Colatini, of the Scipios, of the Servilii, and of the
Metelli, canst thou deem the buried inmates wretched?" (Cicero).</p>

<p><i>Passing under the</i> Arch of Constantine, <i>down the</i> Via Triumphalis
(Via d' S. Gregorio), <i>we turn to the left</i>; passing a rope walk, <i>the first
gate on the left admits to a vineyard</i>. The cottage is erected on the
site of</p>

<h4>THE PORTA CAPENA.</h4>

<p>For a long number of years the present Porta S. Sebastiano
(Porta Appia) was considered to be the Porta Capena. This error
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
was rectified after the stone which marked the first mile was
found (1584) in the Vigna Naro outside the present gate. From
it one mile (one thousand paces) was measured backwards, and
the result was the discovery of the exact site of the Porta Capena
by Mr. J. H. Parker in 1868; but the excavations have been
filled in. The remains consist of the sill of the gate, with fragments
of the jambs, and the pavement of the Via Appia with the
raised footpath on each side of it. The west flanking tower of
the gate is under the gardener's cottage. This was reopened in
1877. The gate was crossed by the Aqua Appia (Frontinus), which
Juvenal mentions as dripping, and Martial as showering down
drops.</p>

<p>The Porta Capena is represented twice in the reliefs of Trajan
built on to the Arch of Constantine. In the days of Tullus Hostilius,
<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 668, Horatius killed his sister outside this gate. "A tomb of
squared stone was raised for Horatia, on the spot where she fell"
(Livy, i. 26).</p>

<p>We now arrive at the river Almo (Marrana), which flows through</p>

<h4>THE VALLEY OF THE MUSES,</h4>

<p>under the C&oelig;lian Hill, in which is the Fountain of Egeria, whence
flowed the perennial fountain by whose waters Numa caught inspiration
from the lips of his lovable nymph. Juvenal describes the
spot in his description of the parting of Umbricius and himself:
"This is the place where Numa consulted his nocturnal friend the
nymph: now the grove of the sacred font is occupied by the remains
of Jews." "In the valley of Egeria we descended into caves unlike
the true." They strolled from the Porta Capena whilst the waggon
was loading. At length Umbricius says: "The sun is getting low&mdash;I
must depart; for long ago the muleteer gave me a hint by cracking
his whip."</p>

<p>"Numa was commanded by the nymph Egeria to consecrate that
place and the fields about it to the Muses, where he had often entertained
a free intercourse and communication with them; and that
the fountain which watered that place should be made sacred and
hallowed for the use of the vestal virgins, who were to wash and
clean the penetralia of their sanctuary with those holy waters"
(Plutarch).</p>

<p>Livy (i. 21) thus describes it: "There was a grove, in the midst
of which, from a dark cavern, gushed a fountain of flowing water,
whither often, because without witness, Numa went to have an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
interview with the goddess, and which grove he consecrated to the
muses, that their councils might be held there with Egeria." The
fountain may still be seen under the C&oelig;lian, over the wall on the
left;&mdash;there is a bath-house of the middle ages built over it. It is in
the grounds of the villa of Baron Hoffmann, <i>to whom application
must be made to visit it</i>.</p>

<p><i>Crossing the</i> Marrana, <i>we take the first turning on the right</i>, <span class="smcap">Via
Antonina</span>. <i>This lane leads to the</i></p>

<h4>BATHS OF CARACALLA.</h4>

<p><i>Admission one lira; Sundays free.</i></p>

<p>A favourite spot of Shelley's&mdash;"among the flowery glades and
thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees, which are extended in ever
winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches
suspended in the air." So the poet wrote of this spot. But now it
is all changed: the hand of the explorer has ruthlessly pulled up
the trees, and scraped the wild flowers and weeds from the ruined
walls, exposing beautiful mosaic pavements, it is true, but which
hardly repay for the loss of nature's verdure.</p>

<p>The magnificent Thermæ of Caracalla display in the clearest and
most complete manner the skeleton of an edifice of this kind&mdash;these
glorious ruins standing, as it were, intact before us.</p>

<p>They were begun by Caracalla in the year 212, enlarged by Heliogabalus,
and completed by Alexander Severus; their area being 140,000
square yards&mdash;length, 1840 yards by 1476. As many as 1600
persons could, it is said, bathe in them at the same time. The baths,
properly so called, were 1720 feet in length and 375 in width, and
they were surrounded by pleasure-gardens, porticoes, a stadium, &amp;c.
The reservoir was supplied by the Antonine aqueduct, which
carried the water from the Claudian over the Arch of Drusus. The
principal entrance to the baths was from the Via Nova, one of the
favourite promenades of the ancient Romans, made by Caracalla.
Among the works of art discovered in the thermæ may be mentioned
the Farnese Hercules, the Colossal Flora, the Farnese Bull, the
Atreus and Thyestes, the Two Gladiators, and the Venus Callipyge.
The bronzes, cameos, bas-reliefs, medals, &amp;c., found in the thermæ
are too numerous to mention. The urns in green basalt now in the
Vatican Museum, and the granite basins of the Piazza Farnese,
formerly belonged to the Baths of Caracalla. The baths remained
entire, both as regards their architecture and their internal decoration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
until the middle of the sixth century, when the aqueducts were
destroyed by Vitiges.</p>

</div>
<p>The portion of this series of main chambers, with which all the
others are connected, like the limbs of an organic body, was a
rotunda. The open space at the foot of the Aventine was intended
for a stadium. The games held in it could be viewed from the tiers of
seats, which rose, as in a theatre, above the reservoir, still in existence,
on the declivity of the hill. From this the building was supplied
with water, conveyed to the different points by means of an aqueduct.</p>

<p>In order to attain a correct idea of the ground-plan, we must
proceed to the space in the centre, enclosed on the side towards the
road by a high wall furnished with window niches for the reception
of statues. This was the great swimming-bath, as is proved by the
excavations, which have revealed the deep level of the original floor.
Beyond this are small rooms where the bathers were oiled and
shampooed; beyond these again is the <span class="smcap">Grand Peristylium</span>, enclosed
with pillars and a portico, in which were performed the athletic
exercises; adjoining were the Women's Baths. Returning through
the <span class="smcap">Hemicyclia</span>, we enter the <span class="smcap">Pinacotheca</span>, or Fine Art Gallery.
This brings us to the <span class="smcap">Tepidarium</span>, or Warm Bath, with four hot
baths, <span class="smcap">Caldaria</span>, at the corners, from which the <span class="smcap">Sudatorium</span>, or
Sweating Room, was entered. This was called the <span class="smcap">Cella Solearis</span>.
The roof was supported by bars of brass interwoven like the straps
of a sandal. Vitruvius tells us that the Sudatorium ought to be
circular, with a circular window in the centre of the dome, with a
shutter to be opened or shut,&mdash;thus controlling the atmosphere as
required. The Solearis was considered a great architectural feat,
and inimitable. Of this grand rotunda only four piers are left,
but these are sufficient to give an idea of its size; and it was to the
Baths of Caracalla what the Pantheon was to the Baths of Agrippa:
that is the only perfect part of those baths left; this is the only part
of these baths wanting.</p>

<p>The mosaics of the pavement have sunk down, as it were, in the
form of troughs, in consequence of the piers on which the arches
rested, as on a sort of grating, having been broken when the latter
fell in, and not being properly shored up when excavated.</p>

<p>The remainder of the building recently excavated corresponds with
the parts we have described.</p>

<p>Some of the beautiful mosaic pavements may be seen in the
Lateran and Borghese Villa Palaces.</p>

<p><i>Above the baths, on an eminence of the Aventine, is the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. BALBINA,</h4>

<p>supposed to date from the sixth century. There is nothing of interest
in the church itself, but from the tower a fine prospect is enjoyed of
the surrounding district. The convent and church have been turned
into a penitentiary and a barrack.</p>

<p><i>Resuming our ramble along the main road, on the right is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF SS. NEREO E ACHILLEO,</h4>

<p>founded by Leo III. (795&ndash;816). It contains an enclosed choir with
reading-desks. The tribune mosaic is of the founder's time, and
represents the Transfiguration and Annunciation. The episcopal
chair is that from which S. Gregory read his Twenty-eighth Homily.</p>

<p>The church is on the site of the</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF MARS,</h4>

<p>erected during the Gallic war, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 387 (Livy, vi. 5). "The same
day is a festival of Mars, whom the Capenian Gate beholds, outside
the walls, situated close to the covered way" (Ovid, "Fasti," vi. 191).
"They paved with square stones the road from the Capenian Gate to
the Temple of Mars," <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 456 (Livy, x. 23). Repaired <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 563
(<i>Ibid.</i>, xxxviii. 28). "The Curule Ædiles completed the paving of
the road from the Temple of Mars to Bovillæ," <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 459 (<i>Ibid.</i>, xi.
47). Mr. Parker found some remains of this temple in excavating
at the back of the church. From here the Roman knights used to
ride to the Temple of Castor in the Forum, on the anniversary of the
battle of Lake Regillus (Dionysius, xi. 13).</p>

<p><i>Nearly opposite is the</i> <span class="smcap">Church of S. Sisto</span>, belonging to the Irish
Dominican friars of S. Clement, on the site of the</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF HONOUR AND VIRTUE.</h4>

<p>"Marcellus was desirous to dedicate to Honour and Virtue the
temple which he had built out of the Sicilian spoils, but was opposed
by the priests, who would not consent that two deities should be
contained in one temple. Taking this opposition ill, he began
another temple" (Plutarch. See Livy, xxvii. 25; xxix. 11).</p>

<p>"M. Marcellus, the grandson of the conqueror of Syracuse, erected
statues to his father, himself, and grandfather near the Temple of
Honour and Virtue, with this inscription&mdash;III. <span class="smcap">Marcelli novies
coss</span>" (Cicero, Asconius).</p>

<p>This temple must not be confounded with the temple erected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Marius on the Capitoline, and restored by Vespasian. The Temple
of Honour could not be reached without passing through the Temple
of Virtue.</p>

<p><i>Opposite, in the Vigna Guidi, No. 19</i>, are the remains of</p>

<h4>THE HOUSE OF HADRIAN.</h4>

<p>The chambers occupy three sides of a square peristylium, the
walls of which are painted with frescoes, the pavements being black
and white mosaics forming hippocampi, with rams' heads, Tritons,
and nymphs.</p>

<p>Opening out from the peristylium is the Lararium, or room of the
household gods. Here was probably the site of the Villa of Asinius
Pollio, the orator in the time of Augustus; for Pliny mentions that in
his gardens stood the statue now at Naples, called the Farnese Bull,
which was actually found amidst these ruins in 1554. Hence it
became the private house of Hadrian, and was destroyed to build
the Baths of Caracalla.</p>

<p>Continuing our ramble, <i>on the left</i>, the Via della Ferratella leads
to the Lateran. It has a fourth century <span class="smcap">Shrine of the Lares</span>,
with niches for statues.</p>

<p><i>Beyond, on the right, is</i> <span class="smcap">S. Cesareo</span>, containing a raised presbytery,
surrounded by a marble screen, a marble pulpit, and an ancient
episcopal chair. Adjoining is part of the titular-cardinal's house, of
the twelfth century. <i>It is on the site of</i></p>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF TEMPESTAS,</h4>

<p>erected by Cornelius Scipio, <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 495.</p>

<p>"Thee too, O Tempest, we acknowledge to have deserved a shrine,
at the time when our fleet was almost overwhelmed by the waves of
Corsica" (Ovid, "Fasti," vi. 193).</p>

<p><i>To the left is</i></p>

<h4>THE VIA LATINA,</h4>

<p>so called because it led through the Latin states. It branched out
of the Via Appia on the left, outside the Porta Capena and within
the Porta S. Sebastiano. A short distance up the Via Latina is the</p>

<h4>PORTA LATINA.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Closed.</i>)</p>

<p>On the keystone is a Greek cross within a circle. The outside of
the arch is reached by passing through the Porta S. Sebastiano and
turning to the left. It is formed of two round brick towers and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
travertine stone arch, with grooves for a portcullis; on the outside keystone
are the early Christian emblems of the <i>labarum</i>. The Roman
Catholic tradition is that S. John the Evangelist was thrown into a
caldron of boiling oil inside this gate, where the circular church now
stands.</p>

<p>Opposite is the Church of S. John, Port Latin.</p>

<p>The little round church is called</p>

<h4>S. GIOVANNI IN OLEO.</h4>

<p>Mr. G. G. Scott lately discovered, at the Chapter House, Westminster,
some frescoes representing the Visions of S. John, fourteenth
century, which are described in the following inscriptions, translated
by Canon Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To the most pious Cæsar, always Augustus, Domitian, the Proconsul
of the Ephesians sends greeting:&mdash;We notify to your majesty
that a certain man named John, of the nation of the Hebrews,
coming into Asia, and preaching Jesus crucified, has affirmed him to
be the true God and the Son of God; and he is abolishing the
worship of our invincible deities, and is hastening to destroy the
temples erected by your ancestors. This man, being contrariant&mdash;as
a magician and a sacrilegious person&mdash;to your imperial edict, is converting
almost all the people of the Ephesian city, by his magical
arts and by his preaching, to the worship of a man who has been
crucified and is dead. But we, having a zeal for the worship of the
immortal gods, endeavoured to prevail upon him by fair words and
blandishments, and also by threats, according to your imperial edict,
to deny his Christ, and to make offerings to the immortal gods.
And since we have not been able to induce him by any methods to
do this, we address this letter to your majesty, in order that you
may signify to us what it is your royal pleasure to be done with him."</p>

<p>"As soon as Domitian had read this letter, being enraged, he sent
a rescript to the proconsul, that he should put the holy John in
chains and bring him with him from Ephesus to Rome, and there
assume to himself the judgment according to the imperial command."</p>

<p>"Then the proconsul, according to the imperial command, bound
the blessed John the Apostle with chains, and brought him with
him to Rome, and announced his arrival to Domitian, who, being
indignant, gave command to the proconsul that the holy John
should be placed in a boiling caldron, in presence of the senate, in
front of the gate which is called the Latin Gate, when he had been
scourged, which was done. But, by the grace of God protecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
him, he came forth uninjured and exempt from corruption of the
flesh. And the proconsul, being astonished that he had come forth
from the caldron anointed but not scorched, was desirous of
restoring him to liberty, and would have done so if he had not
feared to contravene the royal command. And when tidings of these
things had been brought to Domitian, he ordered the holy Apostle
John to be banished to the island called Patmos, in which he saw
and wrote the Apocalypse, which bears his name, and is read by us."</p>

<h4>THE TOMB OF LUTATIUS CATULUS</h4>

<p>is a lofty concrete tomb of the time of the republic, on the left, near
the Church of S. John. This may be the general who ended the
First Punic War, 242 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, or his descendant consul, 102 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, proscribed
by Marius, and who suffocated himself with charcoal fumes.</p>

<p><i>Behind the round chapel is</i></p>

<h4>THE COLUMBARIA OF HYLAS AND VITALINE.</h4>

<p>The columbaria were underground chambers, containing niches in
the walls, in which were placed the urns containing the ashes of
those who were burned. As the niche was like a dove's nest in shape,
it was called a "columbarium," the whole tomb a "columbaria." This
one was discovered by the Marchese Campana, and is carefully preserved.
Here were buried the freedmen of Augustus while Hylas
and Vitaline were the custodians.</p>

<p><i>Returning to the Via Appia</i>, the second gate on the left admits to
the</p>

<h4>CHAPEL OF THE SEVEN SLEEPERS,</h4>

<p>dedicated to S. Gabriel and the Sleepers of Ephesus. It was
decorated in fresco by the same Beno and Maria de Rapiza who
did the frescoes in S. Clement's towards the end of the eleventh
century.</p>

<p>Beyond, a tall cypress tree marks the entrance to the (No. 13)</p>

<h4>TOMB OF THE SCIPIOS.</h4>

<p>The vaults, hewn in the tufa, with the traces of a cornice over the
entrance arch, and the stump of a Doric column, are all that now
remain. The tomb was discovered in 1780; and the bones of the
consul, found in good preservation, were carried to Padua, where
they were interred by Senator Quirini. Six sarcophagi were found,
and several recesses for more bodies; the original inscriptions were
removed to the Vatican and placed in the vestibule of the Belvedere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>Lucius Scipio Barbatus, his son; Aula Cornelia, wife of Cneius
Scipio Hispanus, a son of Scipio Africanus, senior; Lucius Cornelius,
son of Asiaticus; Cornelius Scipio Hispanus and his son Lucius,
were buried here. Africanus senior was buried at Liternum.</p>

<p>From this tomb we can ascend into a brick tomb of the second
century.</p>

<h4>TOMB OF CORNELIUS TACITUS.</h4>

<p>This is probably the tomb of the historian, who died about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 130.
The following inscription was found here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>CORNELIO TACITO<br />

<p><i>Just beyond, in the</i> <span class="smcap">Vigna Codini</span> (No. 14), <i>are the Columbaria of</i></p>

<h4>THE OFFICERS OF CÆSAR'S HOUSEHOLD.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Memorials of those mentioned by S. Paul.</i>)</p>

<p>Two columbaria lie upon the right of the pathway, and possess considerable
interest, not only as good specimens of the chambers where
the ashes of those who were cremated were deposited, but special
interest is attached to some of the names found therein&mdash;names that
are mentioned in the New Testament. The question arises, Are
these the remains of those there mentioned? Can we still look upon
the ashes of those early Christians? Let us see.</p>

<p>In the first columbaria we find this inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>
D.M. TRYPHAENAE . VALERIAS . TRYPHAENAE . MATRI. B. M. F. ET .<br />
VALERIAS . FUTIANUS.<br />
[Tryphænæ Valeria and Valerius Futianus to the memory of the mother Tryphæna.]</p>

<p>Just beyond is&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>DOMITIAE.) . L. FAUSTILLAE . PETRONIO . ARISTONIS . L. EPAPHRAE.</p>
</div>

<p>On the stair wall is a Greek inscription to Onesimus.</p>

<p>On the outside of the second columbaria, built into the wall, is&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>D.M. VARIA . TRYPHOSA . PATRONA . ET . M . EPPIUS . CLEMENS . CONIUGI .<br />

[Varia Tryphosa, patron, and M. Eppius Clemens erected this to his well-beloved wife,
who lived thirty years.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>Close by is&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

PRYPHO) . C. JULIUS . ONESI . MUS . TULIA . EUTHI . CIA . JULIA .

</div>

<p>Inside the second, <i>in situ</i>, is the inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>ONESIMUS . A . PORTICU.</p>
</div>

<p>The first columbaria was for the servants or officers of the
imperial family, and dates from Augustus to Nero, both inclusive.
The second dates from Julius Cæsar to Tiberius. The historic
notices of some of those names are valuable.</p>

<p>S. Paul, writing to the Romans from Corinth, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 60, says, "Salute
Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord" (Rom. xvi. 12).</p>

<p>Writing from Rome to the Colossians, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 64, he says, "With
Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother" (Col. iv. 9); and to
Philemon: "I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have
begotten in my bonds" (Phil. 10). In Colossians i. 7: "As ye also
learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant;" and in iv. 12 we have:
"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ"&mdash;who is again
mentioned in Philemon: "There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner
in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 23).</p>

<p>Now, these names are uncommon, and we only have them mentioned
by S. Paul, and engraved on these marble slabs, which slabs are
in the columbaria of the freedmen of the Cæsars, agreeing in date
with the time of S. Paul's letters; who himself preached to, and had
converts amongst, the household of Cæsar, in the imperial palace
upon the Palatine Hill. He says, writing to the Philippians, "So
that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all
other places" (Phil. i. 13). And (iv. 22), "All the saints salute you,
chiefly they that are of Cæsar's household."</p>

<p>The name Valeria was taken, when she obtained her freedom,
from her mistress, the Empress Messalina (whose name was Valeria).
These names do not cover their own ashes&mdash;with the exception of
that to Onesimus and Epaphras&mdash;but are memorial-stones erected to
fellow-servants, who, if we may judge from the "<span class="smcap">D.M.</span>" over the inscriptions,
were not Christians.</p>

<p>They record a work of charity and love to fellow-servants, though
not co-religionists; and the names mentioned may well be those
likewise named by S. Paul, with the exception of Onesimus, who
was sent back to his master.</p>

<p>The names Tryphena and Tryphosa occur before the coming of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Paul to Rome, and these, with some others mentioned by him (Rom.
xvi.), were found on slabs in another columbaria, about a mile further
on, on the Via Appia, discovered in 1726, and known as the Columbaria
of the servants of Livia Augusta. It is now a complete ruin&mdash;one
wall only remaining&mdash;and some of the inscriptions are in the
Capitol Museum.</p>

<p>The following names, according to Gruter, p. 1070, No. 1, and
p. 656, No. 1, were there, but they are now lost:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>AMPLIAS . URBANUS . APELLES . TRYPHANE . TRYPHOSA . RUFUS .
HERMES . PATROBAS . HERMAS . PHILOLOGUS . JULIA . NEREUS.</p>
</div>

<p>These are the names probably of some members of the church
founded by Priscilla and Aquila, whom Paul greets in writing to
Rome, but who are not mentioned again by him after his arrival in
Rome. They possibly were no longer living, and the church was
dispersed under Claudius, Aquila and Priscilla, whom Paul salutes in
his second letter to Timothy (iv. 19), going to Corinth (Acts xviii. 2).</p>

<p>Another columbaria, well preserved, lies on the left of the path at
the entrance.</p>

<h4>THE ARCH OF DRUSUS</h4>

<p>next draws our attention.</p>

<p>The aqueduct which supplied the Thermæ of Caracalla crossed the
road a few steps before the Aurelian Gate of the city, the Porta Appia
(now called the Porta S. Sebastiano), where an arch of travertine,
adorned with white marble and pillars of various colours (still standing)
was employed to convey the aqueduct over the road. The arch
itself is evidently much older than the aqueduct, and has, consequently,
been pronounced by antiquaries to be the triumphal arch
awarded to Drusus by a decree of the senate, and said to have been
erected to him on the Appian Way. It was supported by four
columns of African marble, relieved by four niches and an attic
above a small pediment; the whole was surmounted by an equestrian
statue between two trophies, as shown upon a coin. "The senate
likewise decreed for Drusus a triumphal arch of marble, with trophies,
over the Appian Way, and gave him the cognomen of Germanicus"
(Suetonius, "Claudius," i.).</p>

<p><i>Passing under, we come to</i></p>

<h4>THE PORTA APPIA</h4>

<p>(now Sebastiano), opening on the great highway of ancient Rome, the
<span class="smcap">Via Appia</span>. This gate is the finest in the Aurelian walls, and, in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
splendid decorations, regard has evidently been paid to the road over
which it was built. All the rectangular stones of the substruction
are of white marble. It is curious, too, that considerable projections
have been left on most of the stones on the right side, whilst the
others present a smoothly hewn surface, evidently old material re-used.</p>

<p>A fresco painting of the Madonna, said to be of the sixth century,
probably the work of a Greek soldier under Belisarius (as the character
of the painting is Byzantine), remains in the corridor of Aurelian
near this gate. It was over the head of the sentinels in the path and
near the third tower on the right side of the gate. The existence of
this painting was not known until it was discovered accidentally by
Mr. J. H. Parker, C.B., in 1870. <i>Entrance, first gate on the left, inside
the Arch of Drusus.</i> The gate-house is said to have been built, in the
time of King Theodoric, out of the ruins of the Temple of Mars,
which stood outside this gate. It was necessary for the Temple of
Mars to be outside the gate, and this one was erected when the one
outside the Porta Capena became obsolete, being within the Aurelian
walls.</p>

<p>Behind the right hand wooden gate are a figure of S. Michael and
a Gothic inscription cut in the marble, recording the repulse of Louis
of Bavaria in 1327.</p>

<p><i>Descending</i> the Hill of Mars, on the left, built into a house, is an unknown
tomb. Beyond, we cross the other branch of the Almo. <i>Upon
the left is</i></p>

<h4>THE SEPTIZONIA OF GETA,</h4>

<p>the murdered brother of Caracalla. The tomb now only shows a huge
mass of concrete. It was named after its shape, and was like the
portico erected by Septimius Severus to the Palace of the Cæsars
(Spartianus).</p>

<p><i>On the right, behind the osteria, is the</i></p>

<h4>TOMB OF PRISCILLA.</h4>

<p>Statius sang of the conjugal love of Abascantius, who interred his
wife Priscilla before the city, where the Appian Way branches out,
and where Cybele haunts the stream of the Almo.</p>

<p>To the mouth of the Almo the priests of Cybele brought the statue
of the goddess once a year and washed it in the waters, together with
the sacred utensils used in her worship.</p>

<p>The tower is medieval, showing it to have been turned into a
fortress.</p>

<p><i>On the left is the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF DOMINE QUO VADIS.</h4>

<p>So called from the legend that S. Peter, when escaping from Rome,
was met by our Saviour at this spot. Peter asked of him, "Domine,
quo vadis?" to which Jesus replied, "Venio iterum crucifigi," which
caused the apostle to return to his doom. They show on a small
piece of marble two footprints, which they say is where the Lord
stood&mdash;he having left the imprint of his feet on a piece of white
marble in a road paved with silex. We don't believe it; but our
readers may, if they like. The original is in the Church of S. Sebastiano.
<i>The Via Ardeatina goes off to the right.</i> Just beyond, where
the lane turns off to the left, Cardinal Pole erected the little round
shrine as the exact spot where Jesus stood.</p>

<h4>THE TOMB OF ANNIA REGILLA.</h4>

<p><i>From the Via Appia, just beyond the "Domine quo Vadis," a lane
leads into the valley of the Caffarella. At the end of the lane, upon the
left</i>, is a beautiful brick tomb of the time of the Antonines. This is
popularly known as the Temple of the Dio Rediculo. We have
raised objections to this: first, because Pliny ("Nat. Hist.," x. 43) says
the Campus Rediculi was at the second mile on the <i>right</i> of the Via
Appia, whilst this ruin is upon the <i>left</i>; and secondly, from its construction,
which shows it to have been a tomb. We have always
considered this as the tomb of Annia Regilla, the wife of Herodes
Atticus, consul <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 143. It stands upon his estate, where we know
he erected a sepulchre to his wife, consecrating the surrounding
land to Minerva and Nemesis. He was of Greek origin, and the
ornaments are of Greek design; they are beautifully executed and
well preserved, particularly the zigzag border. This view of ours has
been recently confirmed: in digging up the soil at the base of the
tomb, the following portion of the inscription has been found,&mdash;it is
cut on a piece of <i>rosso-antico</i>:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Annia Regilla">
<tr>
<td class="tdc">ANNIA REGILLA</td>
<td class="tdc">Annia Regilla,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">HERODIS VXOR</td>
<td class="tdc">the wife of Herodes,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">LVMEN DOMVS</td>
<td class="tdc">light of the house,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">CVIVS HAEC</td>
<td class="tdc">whose this</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">PRAEDIA FVERV</td>
<td class="tdc">estate was</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In an inscription in the Louvre she is called "the light of the
house, the lady of the land,"&mdash;these estates came to Herodes through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Annia,&mdash;and in the newly found inscription she is called light of the
house. Thus they both refer to the same lady whose tomb is here
recognized.</p>

<p>The word <i>rediculo</i> is supposed by some to come from <i>redeo</i>, I return,
as applied to the spot where Hannibal turned back from Rome;
but from Pliny we know there was a place called Campus Rediculi, and
that it was to the right of the Via Appia in coming out of the city,
so it could have nothing to do with this field. Pompeius Festus, a
Latin critic of the fourth century, ascribes it to the above meaning,
but he would be no authority. Hannibal's camp was on the road to
Tivoli, and from there he returned. "Hannibal moved his camp forward
to the river Anio, three miles from the city. Posting there his
troops, he himself, with two thousand horsemen, proceeded from the
Colline Gate as far as the Temple of Hercules, riding about, and taking
as near a view as possible of the situation and fortifications of
the city" (Livy, xxvi. 10). "Discouraged by all circumstances, he
moved his camp to the river Tutia, six miles from the city"
(<i>Ibid.</i>, xi.).</p>

<p>The tomb is built of yellow bricks, with red brick basement,
pilasters, and ornaments: on one side is the pediment of the portico,
which was formed with peperino columns. Over the square doorway
is a decorated niche for the statue. The tomb contained originally two
chambers, but the flooring of the upper one has been destroyed&mdash;thus
making one&mdash;the vault of which was decorated with stucco ornaments.
In construction it is like the painted tombs on the Via Latina, the
bricks being carefully baked and laid with very little mortar between
them, not unlike the entrance to some of the warehouses at Ostia, and
of the same date&mdash;time of Hadrian; for being a tomb, and not cased
with marble, it shows more careful construction than the ordinary
brickwork of the time of that emperor.</p>

<p>Proceeding on our ramble along the Via Appia, <i>upon the left</i> is an
unknown tomb; <i>on the right</i>, beyond, another. This is exactly at
the second mile from the Porta Capena. Here was the Campus
Rediculi. Was this the raven's tomb? (See <a href="#Page_18">page 18</a>.) The vineyard
on the left contained the Columbaria of Livia, now destroyed. <i>Beyond</i>,
entrance to the Catacomb of Prætextatus. <i>Upon the right</i>,</p>

<h4>TOMB OF THE CÆCILII,</h4>

<p>a shapeless mass of rubble. Several epitaphs to this family have

<h4>CATACOMBS OF S. CALIXTUS.</h4>

<p><i>Fee, one lira each, which includes guides and lights.</i></p>

<p>Catacomb is a medieval word, and is said by some authorities to
be derived from the Greek words κατὰ , under, and κύμβος, a hollow.
The Romans called these burial-places cemeteries. They generally
consist of three strata of tufa: <i>litoide</i>, of a red conglomeration, hard,
used for building; <i>pozzolana pura</i>, a friable sand, for mortar; and
<i>granolare</i>, harder, but easily cut, of which the catacombs were almost
exclusively made.</p>

<p>A catacomb consists of passages or long narrow galleries cut with
regularity, so that the roof and floor are at right angles to the sides,
running quite straight, but crossed by others, and these again by
others, forming a complete labyrinth of subterranean corridors,&mdash;the
sides are honeycombed with graves. Their narrowness was to
economize space, and to make the most of the limited area. These
corridors, themselves the cemetery, lead into different chambers.
Rome is surrounded by about sixty of these catacombs, each taking
its name from the saint that reposed there.</p>

<p>The catacombs began to be formed at the beginning of the third
century <span class="s08">A.D.</span>, and originated from a pagan tomb. We find no exception
to this in the early catacombs. Just inside the gate is a pagan
tomb, second century, from which a flight of steps leads into the
catacomb. This tomb belonged to the family, and when it was filled,
instead of building a new tomb or buying another site, they dug
down and made another chamber in the tufa rock below, and so on.
In the course of time the proprietor became a Christian, and probably
left his property to the Church. The tomb became popular,
and it was enlarged gradually; the passages serving for the poor, and
the chambers for the family tombs, which were paid for. They
were lighted by means of shafts, which still exist; and there was no
concealment&mdash;they were the public recognized burial-places, and
when Christianity was the nominal religion of the state, pagans and
Christians were both buried here. We find pagan inscriptions, emblems
(other than those adopted by the Christians), and pagan
family tombs. The pagan frescoes are much better works of art than
the Christian; for the Christians had to be educated, whilst the pagans
already knew. Early Christian frescoes are very rude daubs (see
those of Jonah), and they gradually advanced till the ninth century,
when we have the Byzantine school (see S. Cecilia). This latter
style was used for the pilgrims after the bodies, all looked upon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
martyrs, were removed to the churches in Rome; which gave rise to
the story that the catacombs lead to Rome, which is not true.
Neither is it correct that the catacombs were old quarries used up by
the Christians, though there was often an entrance into them from a
quarry. Most of the inscriptions are in the Vatican and Lateran:
they would be far more interesting where they were found.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The air is pure; the vaults are dry, and they are not cold.</p>

<p>The entrance is near the ancient church in which Pope Damasus,
who died <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 384, was buried. Descending the steps we enter the
vestibule, the walls of which are covered with the names of pilgrims;
a narrow gallery conducts us to the Chapel of the Bishops&mdash;Lucius,
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 232; Anterus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 235; Fabianus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 236; Eutychianus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
275. Following the names of Lucius and Fabianus are the words,
"Epis, martyr." Urbanus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 223, and Sixtus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 258, were both
buried here. In front of the grave of the latter is the inscription
put up by Damasus, engraved in beautiful characters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">INSCRIPTION OF POPE DAMASUS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE BISHOPS.</p>

</div>

<p>In front was the altar. From here a gallery leads to the Crypt of S.
Cecilia, where her body was placed after martyrdom by Priest Urban,
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 203. From this resting-place it was removed in 820 by Paschal I.
(See <a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a>.) The body was found "fresh and perfect as when it was
first laid in the tomb, and clad in rich garments mixed with gold, with
linen cloths stained with blood rolled up at her feet." On the wall is a
fresco of S. Cecilia attired in a dress of Byzantine character. Below are
two others&mdash;on the left, Christ, with a nimbus; on the right, Urban in
full pontifical dress: they are of the ninth century. After traversing
some passages, we enter the cubicula of a family. On the walls are
roughly executed frescoes of the Baptism of Christ in Jordan by John,
the story of Jonah and the Large Fish, Moses striking the Rock, the
Woman at the Well of Samaria, the Paralytic Man walking with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Bed&mdash;doves, emblems of immortality, on the sides. At the end are two
fossori, or grave-diggers, between whom are three subjects in fresco,
representing two men, one on either side of a tripod on which something
is cooking; and next it, seven people seated at a table, beyond
which are two figures and some sheep or lambs. These frescoes seem
to us to represent the scenes at the Lake of Tiberias, after the resurrection
of our Lord, as recorded in the twenty-first chapter of S. John.
They certainly agree with the story: "There were together Simon
Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,
and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples" (ver. 2)&mdash;"But
when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:
but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus" (ver. 4)&mdash;"As soon as
they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid
thereon, and bread" (ver. 9)&mdash;"Jesus saith unto them, Come and
dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou?
knowing that it was the Lord" (ver. 12)&mdash;"Jesus then cometh, and
taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise" (ver. 13)&mdash;"So
when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea,
Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my
lambs" (ver. 15; see also ver. 16, 17). In another sepulchre have
been found two sarcophagi containing remains; the tops are now
covered with glass. Opening out of this sepulchre is another, in which
was found a sarcophagus (fourth century) representing Lazarus being
raised from the dead, the multiplication of the loaves and fishes,
Daniel in the lions' den. Near this is a crypt containing an inscription
having reference to the heresy of Heraclius, on account of which
Eusebius became a voluntary exile. The names of the person who
engraved it&mdash;Furius Dionysius Filocalus&mdash;and of Bishop Damasus are
cut in two vertical lines down the sides. It had served previously
for an inscription to Caracalla, made by M. Asinius Sabinianus. It
was a very usual thing for the early Christians to re-use the marble of
other times, on account of its cheapness, they being mostly poor.</p>

<p>The Chapel of S. Cornelius was originally distinct from these
catacombs. His tomb is marked "Cornelius Martyr. Ep." on the
side-wall fresco of Cornelius and Cyprian; in front is a pillar on
which stood the lamp burning before the shrine.</p>

<p>BEHOLD! A WAY DOWN HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED, AND THE DARKNESS DISPELLED:

</div>

<p>Beyond are two crypts, with a fresco of the Good Shepherd, in
good preservation, on the ceiling, and other Christian emblems. We
emerge into daylight by means of the original stairs, of an early
construction.</p>

<p><i>A little lower down the road, on the left, are the</i> <span class="smcap">Jewish Catacombs</span>,
which, perhaps more than any other, would illustrate that these
catacombs were formerly quarries, because they are rather wide.</p>

<p><i>A little further on we turn down a rough road on the left</i>, leading to
what has been called the "antiquary's despair," the</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF CERES AND FAUSTINA,</h4>

<p>the site of which is now occupied by the deserted <span class="smcap">Church of S.
Urbano</span>. The church was built of brick, and the vestibule is supported
by marble Corinthian pillars. Piranesi saw the name of Faustina
stamped on one of the bricks. The basin in the vestibule containing
the holy water was found near here, and was an altar consecrated
to Bacchus. The inscription says that it was made under the priesthood
of Apronianus. The grove of ilex trees is termed the Sacred
Grove of Bacchus. Tradition says S. Urban, in 222&ndash;30, had an oratory
here under the present altar; and that Urban VIII. (1633) turned the
oratory into a church;&mdash;the paintings and iron bars are of that date.
Below the altar, entered from its side, is a cell, on the end wall of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
which is a fresco, of the eighth century, of the Virgin with Christ,
and SS. John and Urban. The plan of the building is rectangular,
and it is of the time of Antoninus Pius. At the foot of this hill is the
valley of the Almo, or Caffarella, in which is the mossy entrance to a
grotto, for a long time called the Grotto of Egeria, owing to the
misapprehension of the site of the Porta Capena. It is now known
to have been a nymphæum in the</p>

<h4>VILLA OF HERODES ATTICUS.</h4>

<p>This was proved from finding two pedestals, on which are two
Greek inscriptions, copies of which have been placed on the top of
the hill, close by the artificial ruin in the Villa Borghese; the
originals are in the Louvre. This villa formed part of the dowry of
Annia Regilla, wife of Atticus, as we learn from a column, No. 10
in the second Hall of Inscriptions in the Capitol Museum, which
afterwards marked the eighth mile on one of the roads. After
Regilla's death, he consecrated a statue to Regilla in the above
temple. This is denoted by the above inscriptions, which speak of
her as "the light of the house, the lady of the land." The wall at
the back of the vaulted chamber was primarily intended to support
the declivity of the hill, at the foot of which this elegant little
building stands. The niches in the walls were for the reception of
statues. One of these only, a recumbent figure of a river god, has
been preserved, and is supposed to be a personification of the Almo,
which flows past the spot.</p>

<p>Several channels for pipes, concealed in the wall, justify the supposition
that the water poured forth in numerous streams. The
romantic appearance of this spot has been greatly changed by the
stream being turned into an aqueduct in the summer of 1873. A
path leads to the tomb of Annia Regilla.</p>

<p><i>Visitors whose time is limited should continue along the Appian Way
as far as the Tomb of Cecilia Metella, and then retrace their steps to
this road, which leads into the Via Appia Nova (<a href="#Page_328">page 328</a>), and so
return to Rome.</i></p>

<p><i>Regaining the Via Appia, at a short distance on the right is the Via
Sette Chiesa. Some distance down, near the Tor Marancia farm, are the</i></p>

<h4>CATACOMBS OF DOMITILLA.</h4>

<p>The tomb at the entrance dates from the reign of Trajan, and
contained the remains of SS. Nereus and Achilleus; also of Petronilla,
a member of the Aurelii family. The saints were the servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of Domitilla, a daughter or niece of Flavius Clemens, the first of
imperial blood who suffered martyrdom. Domitilla opened this tomb,
which afterwards became a general catacomb, for the remains of her
servants. This is the most ancient Christian catacomb, as may be
seen from the paintings and brickwork of the vestibule. The present
entrance is modern; the catacomb is interesting for its paintings. In
1874 the</p>

<h4>BASILICA OF S. PETRONILLA,</h4>

<p>supposed to have been built about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 400, was discovered, the top
being only a few feet below the ground. It is supposed to have been
originally built for the devotees who resorted to the tombs of the
martyrs, and was destroyed by the Lombardians. On the wall of
the tribune is a <i>graffito</i> of a priest preaching, probably S. Gregory,
whose chair was removed from here to the church of SS. Nereo e
Achilleo. (See <a href="#Page_279">page 279</a>.)</p>

<p>Beneath the floor were discovered many tombs covered over when
the basilica was built. It is being restored as a monument to Monsieur
Merodi.</p>

<p>A fresco was found representing S. Petronilla receiving Veneranda.
Several inscriptions have been found; also the columns which
supported the baldachino, on which are represented the martyrdoms
of SS. Achilleus and Nereus.</p>

<p>The Romans built an altar at the springs of the river Numicius to
Anna, the sister of Dido, who became the wife of the god of the
river Numicius, and was called Anna Perenna. (See Ovid, "Fasti,"
iii. 542.) The Roman Church erected a chapel to her on the same
spot, under the title of Santa Petronilla, said, without scriptural
authority, to have been S. Peter's daughter, and to have died in
Rome, May 30th, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 98, in the reign of Domitian. This could not be
the case, for Domitian died <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 96, and Trajan was emperor before
the last of May <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 98, Nerva having reigned between. <i>Straight on
leads to S. Paul's outside the walls.</i></p>

<p><i>Returning to the Via Appia, on the right is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. SEBASTIANO,</h4>

<p>founded by Constantine, and rebuilt in 1611 from the design of
Ponzio. The front and portico of six granite columns were designed
by Vasanzio. Below the church are the catacombs, open free. A
monk acts as guide. An altar on the right contains Bernini's statue
of Sebastian, and one on the right the famous footprints.</p>

<p><i>Opposite the church</i> are the extensive remains of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<h4>TOMB OF ROMULUS, SON OF MAXENTIUS.</h4>

<p>In front of the Circus of Maxentius, on the Via Appia, stands a
square portico, of which only the high enclosure walls remain. These,
however, are in a state of excellent preservation.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-335" id="i-335"></a>

<a href="images/i-335l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>At the back of</i> the modern premises, in the middle of this enclosure,
are the remains of a considerable circular tomb, in front of which
was a colonnade facing the Via Appia. In all probability this is the
identical building erected by Maxentius in honour of his son
Romulus, who died in the year 300. Representations of this tomb
are to be met with on coins. <i>At the side is the</i></p>

<h4>CIRCUS OF MAXENTIUS,</h4>

<p>erected <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 310, the enclosure walls of which have been preserved
almost entire. These display the interesting phenomenon of pots of
earthenware built into them, which not merely expedited the progress
of the work, but allowed of its being more easily repaired than
was possible in any other mode of construction. Its length was
1574 feet, and breadth 269, and 18,000 spectators could be accommodated
within its vast walls, yet it was a small building compared
with the Circus Maximus (see <a href="#Page_209">page 209</a>). In 1825 three inscriptions
were found proving this to be the circus consecrated to Romulus, son
of Maxentius. Two towers flank the entrance, supposed to have been
the seats for the judges. It is the most perfect specimen of a Roman
circus remaining. <i>On the top of the hill</i> is the "stern round fortress
of other days," known as</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TOMB OF CECILIA METELLA,</h4>

<p>wife of Lucius Cornelius Sylla, and daughter of Quintus Cæcilius
Metellus (Plutarch). The building consists of a circular tower,
seventy feet in diameter, resting on a quadrangular basement made
chiefly of lava and stone, cemented together by lime and pozzuolana,
and strengthened with key-stones of travertine. This ruin, so long
respected as a tomb, was converted into a fortress by Boniface VIII.,
and used as such by the Gaetani, his near relatives. It now belongs
to archæology. Learned men have made it one of their most sacred
resting-places, and it is a favourite resort of tourists and artists. The
inscription on the side facing the road runs as follows: "Cæciliæ&mdash;Q.
Cretici. F.&mdash;Metellæ. Crassi." <i>To the right</i> there are bas-reliefs,
well preserved&mdash;one representing a trophy of victory, another a
slave or a prisoner; both were brought from a tomb about a mile
further on. The tower was built seventy-nine years before Christ.
The construction is very remarkable, on account of the enormous
thickness of the walls, which are of concrete faced with travertine
and lined with brick in the interior. The enormous massiveness of
the structure indicates a rude and semi-barbarous period. Plutarch
speaks of the extravagance of Sylla in funeral ceremonies. Cecilia
Metella had been previously married to the elder Scaurus (Pliny,
xxxvi. 24; xxxvii. 5). "Sylla dreamed, shortly before his death,
that his son Cornelius, who died before his wife, Cecilia Metella,
appeared to him, and summoned him away to join his mother"
(Plutarch).</p>

<p>The inner chamber of the ruin is fifteen feet in diameter, and was
at one time supposed to contain great treasures both of art and coinage.
But the sarcophagus of white marble now in the court of the
Farnese Palace, and <i>believed</i> to have been discovered in or near the
Tomb of Cecilia Metella, is the only treasure it has produced.</p>

<h4>S. NICHOLAS OF BARI.</h4>

"black mail" on the passers-by.</p>

Albano. Considerable remains of tombs exist on each side of the way,
connected with which are many anecdotes and tragedies. Along the
Via Appia a most magnificent prospect of the Campagna is enjoyed,
with its ruined tombs and aqueducts, and the Sabine and Alban Hills in
the distance.</p>

<h4>TOMBS ON THE VIA APPIA.</h4>

<p>From just beyond the tomb of Metella the Via Appia was lost till
excavated by Canina, under Pius IX. (1850&ndash;53), when many of the
tombs were restored, as far as possible, with the fragments.</p>

<h4>APPII FORUM AND THE THREE TAVERNS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Tres Tabernæ</span> was a <i>mutatio</i>, or halting-place, 11 miles from the Porta
Capena on the Via Appia, at the place now called Frattocchie. It is 10
miles from the Porta S. Sebastiano and 11 from the Porta S. Giovanni on
the Via Appia Nova, or 9 English miles 326 yards from the Porta Appia.
Here the four roads from Rome, Tusculum, Alba Longa, and Antium met
and continued southwards as one road. It is still a halting-place, and
taverns necessarily grace it. Its exact location is explicitly pointed out by
Cicero. He says to Atticus (ii. 10), "I had come out of the Antian way
into the Appian way at the Tres Tabernæ, on the Festival of Ceres. When
my Curio, coming from Rome, met me, at the same place came your servant
with letters from you [from Tusculum]. Written at the 10th hour
(4 p.m.), Apl. 12th," <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 58. Continuing his journey to Formiæ, Cicero
again writes to Atticus: "From Appii Forum, at the 4th hour (10 p.m.). I
wrote a little while before from the Tres Tabernæ" (ii. 11). So it took him
six hours to do the 32 miles between Tres Tabernæ and Appii Forum. Cicero
knew the spot well, for it was the scene of the murder of Clodius. "Severus
was detained a prisoner at a state villa at the 13th mile on the Appian way,
where he was strangled, and then brought back to the 8th mile [from the
Porta Appia] and buried in the tomb of Gallienus" ("Excerpta Valesiana,"
iv. 10). "Severus was murdered near to the Tres Tabernæ of Rome by Maximianus;
and his body was placed in the sepulchre of Gallienus, which is 9
miles from the city [Porta Capena] on the Appian way" (Aurelius Victor,
"Ep." xl. 3). Some have located Tres Tabernæ at Sermoneta, 23 miles,
others at Cisterna, 30 miles from Rome. In the first case Cicero would have
taken five hours to do the 20 miles, and in the second case five hours to do
13 miles; besides, the Antian joins the Appian way 11 miles from Rome.
These writers were evidently misled by the medieval forgery known as the
Tabula Peutingeriana, which is in the Vienna Library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Appii Forum</span> was a town of the Volsci, 43 miles from Rome, where travellers
embarked or disembarked, passing the Pontine marshes by means of the
canal. Horace ("Sat." i. 5) describes it as "stuffed with sailors and surly
landlords." These places are interesting, being the meeting-places of the
Roman Christians with St. Paul. "And from Rome, when the brethren
heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernæ"
(Acts xxviii. 15).

<p class="center b12">THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA</p>

<p>extends from Mount Soracte (S. Oreste) southwards to the Alban
Hills, and from the Apennines westwards to the sea. It is watered by
the Tiber and numerous smaller streams; but there are no marshes
except the salt ones by the sea. The soil is mostly composed of tufa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
rock, covered with a few feet of soil&mdash;decayed vegetable matter.
This causes the malaria: for the first rains, after the heat of summer,
which has burned up all the vegetation, pass through the soil and
rest upon the rock; then the hot sun after the rains draws up the
noxious gas, which being dispersed through the air, if inhaled during
sleep, or upon an empty stomach, produces fever.</p>

<p>If the soil, which for many ages has been allowed to lie fallow, were
properly irrigated and cultivated, all this could be obviated. In the
last few years more has been brought under the plough; and if the
government would only plant trees by the road-sides and in the
waste places, the Campagna would soon become as healthy as in the
days of Pliny, who thus describes it:&mdash;"Such is the happy and beautiful
amenity of the Campagna that it seems to be the work of a
rejoicing nature. For, truly, so it appears in the vital and perennial
salubrity of its atmosphere; its fertile plains, sunny hills, healthy
woods, thick groves, rich varieties of trees, breezy mountains, fertility
in fruits, vines, and olives; its noble flocks of sheep and abundant
herds of cattle; its numerous lakes, and wealth of rivers and streams
pouring in upon its many seaports, in whose lap the commerce of the
world lies, and which run largely into the sea, as it were to help mortals."</p>

<p>The surface is by no means flat, but undulating, like the rolling
prairies of America, and presents many points of interest and study
to the artist and the rambler.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h3>PORTA FLAMINIA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Porta del Popolo.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Passing through the Porta del Popolo</i>, built in 1561 by Vignola,
a short walk under the walls, to the right, brings us to the Muro
Torto, a piece of masonry of the time of Sylla, and held to be under
the special protection of S. Peter (Procopius, "B. G." i. 13).</p>

<h4>VILLA BORGHESE.</h4>

<p><i>Closed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</i></p>

<p><i>Turning to the right</i>, just outside the Porta del Popolo, is situated this
the handsomest park in Rome, founded by Cardinal Scipio Borghese.
The grounds are open to all visitors; they cover a wide extent, and
their walks, meadows, and groves are superb and unique in their
general attractions. As a promenade for horsemen, pedestrians,
and carriages, it shares the honours with its neighbour the Pincio.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
After an airing on the latter, a turn through the Porta del Popolo
into this splendid villa generally completes the evening drive of
Romans and tourists. The clatter of hoofs in winter begins at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
and in summer at 7 <span class="s08">P.M.</span> On Sundays a large crowd is collected
within its limits from all quarters of the city, composed of all classes,
from the <i>minente</i> and Albanian nurses bearing babies, to the duchesses
gliding along in landaus. On those days it becomes the paradise
of children, who flock thither with their guardians, and enjoy
a rare frolic in gathering wild flowers, rolling on the grass, and
breathing a far fresher air than the city affords. In the centre of
the villa is the Museum. <i>Open on Saturdays only, from 1 till 4 in
the winter, and 4 till 7 in the summer. Catalogues are provided for
visitors.</i></p>

<p><i>Passing out of the villa, and proceeding along the ancient</i> <span class="smcap">Via
Flaminia</span>, <i>now</i> <span class="smcap">Via Ponte Molle</span> (<i>which is traversed by a tramway</i>),
<i>turning up the lane on the right, at the top we come to the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<h4>VILLA OF PAPA GIULIO.</h4>

<p><i>On the left-hand side, at the corner of the lane</i>, is the Casino,
with sculptured cornices and a fountain. Beyond the Casino, and formerly
connected with it by a corridor, is the villa where Pope Julius
III. best loved to dwell, coming from the Vatican in his barge upon
the Tiber. There remain two rooms with richly decorated ceilings
by Zucchero, and a fine court with a fountain.</p>

<p><i>As the road is very dusty and uninteresting, we will take the lane,
which conducts us, after a pleasant stroll, to the</i></p>

<h4>ACQUA ACETOSA,</h4>

<p>a mineral spring, enclosed in a fountain by Bernini, and surrounded
by a small grove. The view of the Tiber here is very fine, particularly
when the river has risen. On the opposite bank rises the
picturesque ruin, Tor di Quinto, the tomb of Ovid's family. The hill
<i>to the right</i> was the site of Antemnæ. (See <a href="#Page_309">page 309</a>.) <i>Below, on
the left</i>,</p>

<h4>THE PONTE MOLLE</h4>

<p>bursts on our sight. It was built by Pius VII. in 1815, on the foundations
of the Pons Milvius, "which the elder Scaurus is said to have
built" (Marcellinus, xxvii. iii. 9), and near which Constantine defeated
Maxentius, October 27th, 312, a victory so graphically depicted by
Raphael on the Vatican walls. "Maxentius endeavouring to cross
the bridge of boats constructed for the use of his army, a little
below the Ponte Molle, was thrown by his frightened horse into
the waters, and eaten up by the quicksands on account of the weight
of his cuirass. Constantine had great difficulty in finding his corpse"
(Aurelius Victor).</p>

<p><i>Crossing the bridge, the road</i> <i>Via Flaminia</i>, <i>to the right, leads us
to</i> <span class="smcap">Prima Porta</span>, the <span class="smcap">Saxa Rubra</span> of the ancient Romans, the first
halting-place from Rome. <i>On the right, above the Osteria</i>, was situated
the Veientina</p>

<h4>VILLA OF LIVIA,</h4>

<p>(<i>custodian next door to the church</i>), <i>about four miles from the bridge</i>,
discovered in 1863. When first excavated, the frescoes and arabesques
were found in a good state of preservation, but they have
since been greatly damaged by atmospheric influences. Livia was
the wife of Augustus, and mother of Tiberius.</p>

<p>"Formerly, when Livia, after her marriage with Augustus, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
making a visit to her villa at Veii, an eagle flying by let drop in her
lap a hen, with a sprig of laurel (bay) in its mouth, just as it had
been seized. Livia gave orders to have the hen taken care of, and
the sprig of laurel set; and the hen reared such a numerous brood of
chickens, that the villa to this day is called <span class="smcap">The Villa of the Hens</span>.
The laurel grove flourished so much, that the Cæsars procured thence
the boughs and crowns they bore at their triumphs. It was also
their constant custom to plant others in the same spot, immediately
after a triumph; and it was observed that, a little before the death
of each prince, the tree which had been set by him died away. But
in the last year of Nero, the whole plantation of laurels perished to
the very roots, and the hens all died" (Suetonius, "Galba," i.).</p>

<p>Cavaliere Piacentini has discovered (1879), on his farm at Prima
Porta, the remains of some baths, which probably were connected with
Livia's Villa of the Hens. In the centre is a hemicycle, 29 feet in
diameter, the mosaic of which represents circus races, the victor
receiving the palm of victory for his horse Liber; and the three
chariots racing, Romano, Ilarinus, and Olympio. Surrounding this
hall are twelve others, with mosaic pavements of festoons and geometrical
patterns in <i>chiaro-oscuro</i>. One pavement, 26 feet by 20 feet,
represents the sea, in which are numerous fish; while upon the sea
three-winged figures gambol with marine monsters. The boilers for
hot water, furnaces for hot air, and pipes for cold water are in a
capital state of preservation. Brick stamps show that the building
was restored as late as the time of King Theodoric.</p>

<p>Near the bridge over the Fosso di Prima Porta has been found the
circular tomb of Gellius, the freedman of the Emperor Tiberius.</p>

<p><i>The road straight on from the Ponte Molle</i>, <span class="smcap">Via Cassia</span>, <i>leads to</i></p>

<h4>VEII.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Mr. Forbes's carriage excursion-lecture at frequent intervals.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Turn off to the right beyond</i> <span class="smcap">La Storta</span>, <i>at the tenth mile</i>, <span class="smcap">for
Carriages</span>; <i>pedestrians turn off at the fifth mile, near the</i> <span class="smcap">Tomb of
Vibius Marianus, Via Veientina</span>. The site of Veii is surrounded
by two streams, the Cremera and the Fosso de'due Fossi, and is about
twelve miles from Rome. The place was captured after a ten years'
siege by the Romans under Camillus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 393.</p>

<p><i>Descend from the village of</i> <span class="smcap">Isola</span>, by the side of the brook, to the
mill; here the torrent forms a picturesque cascade, 80 feet high,
crossed by the ancient Ponte dell' Isola, with a single arch spanning
22 feet. Here was one of the ancient gates, called Porta de' Sette
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Pagi. <i>Opposite</i> Isola, down the stream, is the Porta dell' Arce.
Under the rock of Isola are some mineral springs, and another gate,
Porta Campana. In the ravine <i>beyond</i> was the Porta Fidenate.
<i>The gates on the other side of the city</i> may be traced by <i>ascending</i> the
valley of the Cremera, Porta di Pietra Pertusa; <i>beyond which</i>, on the
ancient road outside, is a large tumulus, La Vaccareccia. Porta
Spezzeria is higher up, with the remains of a tufa bridge; near by are
the remains of an Etruscan columbaria.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Beyond is Porta Capenate,
under which is Ponte Sodo, a tunnel, 240 feet long, 15 feet broad,
and 20 feet high, cut in tufa for the brook to pass through. Further
on is Porta del Colombario, near a ruined columbaria. <i>Beyond</i> is
the Ponte di Formello, a Roman bridge upon Etruscan piers; <i>close
by</i> is the last gate, Porta Sutrina.</p>

<p>The so-called Piazza d'Armi, the ancient citadel, stands at the
junction of the two streams.</p>

<p>Under Julius Cæsar, within the walls of the ancient city, an <span class="smcap">Imperial
Municipium</span> was founded. Part of a road, some traces of
tombs, and a columbaria mark the site. It seems to have been
founded to occupy the commanding situation, as Florus the historian,
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 116, asks, "Who now knows the site of Veii?" In the middle
ages, for the same reason, the isolated rock was surmounted by a
castle. Cæsar Borgia besieged it for twelve days, and destroyed it.
Isola is considered to have been the necropolis of Veii, from the
sepulchral caves and niches hollowed in the rock.</p>

<p>A pleasant ramble may be had by <i>following the Cremera down to
the Tiber, between the sixth and seventh mile on the Via Flaminia,
thence to Rome</i>.</p>

<p><i>Returning beyond</i> <span class="smcap">La Storta</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Triumphalis</span> <i>leads over</i>
<span class="smcap">Monte Mario</span>. On the height overlooking Rome is</p>

<h4>MONTE MARIO.</h4>

<p>This hill is supposed to take its name from the celebrated Marius,
and the slope down to Rome was called the Clivus Cinnæ, from
Cinna (Gruter, mlxxxi. 1). In 998, from the victory of Otto III.
over the Romans, it was called Monte Malus, hence the bridge over
the Tiber was called Ponte Male; by Evelyn, 1650, Mela; now Ponte
Molle. The hill took its present name from the proprietor in 1409.
It is now Government property, and a fort has been erected on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
height. In making the fort the tomb of Minicia Marcella was
found. Pliny, jr. (v. 16), speaks of the sweetness and early death of
the daughter of Fundanus, consul 107. The inscription says she
lived twelve years, eleven months, and seven days. From the height
a most glorious panorama of the Tiber valley is enjoyed.</p>

<p><i>A path through the woods leads down to</i></p>

<h4>THE VILLA MADAMA.</h4>

<p>The villa was built by Giulio Romano, and it contains some of his
frescoes, representing satyrs and loves, Juno and her peacocks, Jupiter
and Ganymede, and other subjects of mythology. There is a fine
fresco upon a ceiling, representing Ph&oelig;bus driving his heavenly
steeds, by Giovanni da Udine.</p>

<p><i>Passing out into the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Triumphalis</span> by the oak avenue, pausing
a while at the top of the hill to admire "the vast and wondrous
dome," and continuing our ramble, we descend the slopes of Monte
Mario, the ancient <span class="smcap">Clivus Cinnæ</span>.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h3>PORTA SALARA.</h3>

<p>The present gate was built in 1873; outside are some slight remains
of the old one. A short distance down the <span class="smcap">Via Salara</span>, on the
<i>left</i>, Cavalier Bertoni has discovered the tomb of Lucilius and his
sister Polla, with their portraits. It is a grand circular tomb, 117
feet in diameter. Paterculus (ii. 9) speaks of "Lucilius, who in the
Numantine War served in the cavalry under Publius Africanus," <span class="s08">B.C.</span>
103. <i>Opposite is the</i></p>

<h4>VILLA ALBANI.</h4>

<p><i>Beyond the villa is the</i></p>

<h4>CATACOMB OF S. PRISCILLA.</h4>

<p>Priscilla <i>is said</i> to be the Christian name of the mother of Pudens.
Anastasius (xxxi. 31) says this cemetery was made by Bishop Marcellus,
<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 307. There is a burial vault here said to be the tomb of
the family of Pudens; it has some rude frescoes&mdash;a woman coming
out of a house; an orante in act of prayer, called a Madonna; a
woman between two men, twice over. Other frescoes, in different
chambers, are the Three Jews in the Fiery Furnace; Good Shepherd;
four orantes and doves; seven men carrying a barrel, whilst two
others lie on the ground. Scratched on the wall is <span class="smcap">Oratius D. Nobilibus
Antonius Bosius</span>; and underneath was a marble slab&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bonaviæ
Conjugi Sanctissimae</span>; a Good Shepherd; a female figure
seated, with a child in her lap, looking towards a male figure with
hands extended, called the Virgin and Isaiah (query, Joseph)&mdash;between
them is a star. This is the earliest painting of the Virgin
known.</p>

<p><i>Leaving the catacomb, the hill on the left, beyond, was the site of</i></p>

<h4>ANTEMNÆ,</h4>

<p>one of the most ancient cities of the Latin land. It was captured by
the Romans under Romulus, and destroyed by Alaric <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 409, who
encamped here when attacking Rome. Near by, the Anio flows into
the Tiber,&mdash;"with whirlpools dimpled, and with downward force."
A beautiful prospect of the surrounding country may be enjoyed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
The Tiber rolling his yellow billows to the sea, serpent like, through
green meadows; the blue Apennines, with snow-covered summits,
looking patronizingly down upon the village-crowned hills at their
base; the slopes of Monte Mario, dark with cork-wood foliage, <i>on
our left</i>. Sir W. Gell says that the high point nearest the road was
the citadel, below which is a cave that was once a sepulchre. One
gate looked towards Fidenæ, up the Tiber; another towards Rome;
perhaps also one toward Acqua Acetosa; and another in the direction
of the meeting waters.</p>

<p><i>Beyond, the road crosses the Anio by</i></p>

<h4>THE PONTE SALARA,</h4>

<p>rebuilt in 1878. Upon the old bridge Titus Manlius, in <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> 395,
killed the Gaulish giant, and on account of putting the giant's chain
on his own neck took the title of Torquatus (Livy, vii. 10).</p>

<p><i>Beyond</i> the bridge is an unknown tomb. Five miles from Rome is
Castel Giubeleo, the site of</p>

<h4>FIDENÆ,</h4>

<p>"a large and populous city, forty stadia from Rome" (Dionysius, ii.
53; xiii. 28); founded by the Albans, and made a Roman colony
by Romulus, but soon revolted. It was whilst Servius Tullius was
fighting the citizens that he sent and destroyed Alba Longa (Livy).
The place was ultimately taken by Lartius Flavus, the consul, by
means of a mine (Dionysius, v. 70).</p>

<p>There are no remains of the city, but the site is undoubted. The
arx was to the right of the road on the high hill before arriving at
Castel Giubeleo. It is not known when this city was destroyed, but
in <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 27, in the time of Tiberius, the temporary amphitheatre fell
and killed a large number of people. (See Suetonius, "Tiberius," xl.;
"Caligula," xxxi.; Tacitus, "Annals," iv. 62.)</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h3>PORTA PIA.</h3>

<p>This gate was built by Michael Angelo in 1564. It was nearly
destroyed by the Italian troops in 1870, but is now restored.</p>

<p>A fine view of the Villa Albani and the Sabine Hills may be had
from this spot.</p>

<p><i>To the left</i> of the gate a tablet marks where the Italian army
entered Rome on the 20th September 1870.</p>

<p><i>To the right</i> is the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<h4>PORTA NOMENTANA,</h4>

<p>Porta Pia taking its place. The former is flanked by two round
towers. <i>Opposite</i> is the Villa Patrizi, in which is the small catacomb
of S. Nicomedus. <i>Beyond, on the right</i>, is the Villa Lezzani and
the Chapel of S. Giustina.</p>

<p><i>Proceeding down the Via Nomentana a little way, on the right</i> is the</p>

<h4>VILLA TORLONIA,</h4>

<p><i>open on Thursdays, from 11 till 4, with permission to be obtained of
Messrs. Spada and Co.</i> The gallery has many fine paintings and
sculptures, and the gardens are adorned with fountains, statues, and
mock ruins.</p>

<p><i>About a mile further on is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. AGNESE,</h4>

<p>founded by Constantine, on the site where the body of the saint was
found. The aisles are formed by thirty-two columns of fine marble,
and the altar canopy is supported by four columns of porphyry. In
the second chapel on the right is a beautiful altar inlaid with mosaic
work. Pio Nono's escape when the floor fell in, April 15, 1855, is
commemorated by a fresco by Tojetti. The feast of the saint is on
the 21st January, when the lambs are blessed with great ceremony.
Here we have the best idea of a basilica.</p>

<h4>THE CATACOMB OF S. AGNESE.</h4>

<p><i>Entrance in the church. Open on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday.</i></p>

<p>Part of this catacomb under the garden of the monks is well worth
a visit. The entrance to it is through the church, and the exit
through S. Costanza. The original stairs at the entrance were
excavated in 1873, and four pagan tombs were found and two
openings from them into the catacomb, showing that the Catacombs
were general cemeteries, and not <i>exclusively</i> Christian. This catacomb
is interesting, as it is left just as it was found in 1871, many of the
graves being unopened.&mdash;The neighbouring</p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. COSTANZA</h4>

<p>was erected to the memory of Constantine's daughter, Constantina,
who was anything but a saint according to Marcellinus. It is worth
visiting on account of its dome, supported by twenty-four clustered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
columns in granite, and covered with mosaics. The sarcophagus is
now in the Vatican Museum.</p>

<p>S. Costanza is a mausoleum and a baptistery, not properly a
church. The mosaic pictures of the fourth century are the finest
known of that period. Those over the doors are of the eighth century.</p>

<p>"At this time [<span class="s08">A.D.</span> 360] Julian sent the body of his wife Helen,
recently deceased, to Rome, to be buried in the suburb on the road
to Nomentum, where also Constantina, his sister-in-law, the wife of
Gallus, had been buried" (Marcellinus, xxi. i. 5).</p>

<p><i>A quarter of a mile beyond the church, on the left, is the entrance to</i></p>

<h4>THE OSTORIAN CATACOMB.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Custodian, Valentino.</i>)</p>

<p>Signor Armellini has, it is reported, succeeded in deciphering an
inscription in this catacomb, in which the name of S. Peter occurs.
The supposed inscription is in an archway and on the stucco, the
letters being in red colour. This <i>cubiculum</i> is lighted from the top
by an old <i>luminarium</i>, and in shape is not unlike a basilica without
aisles. At a short distance in front of the apse, jutting out from
the right wall, is a chair of tufa, which looks across the chamber;
opposite is a column, coming out in the same manner, above which
is a niche for a lamp. The apse itself is filled up about four feet
above the floor of the chamber, the filling up forming a tomb, the
top of which was probably used as an altar (<i>arcosolium</i>). The
vault of the apse is covered with scroll-worked stucco in very low
relief, coloured red; this has fallen off, only some slight traces of
it remaining, presenting in one or two instances the <i>appearance</i> of
letters, which, we should say, it was impossible to make out. This is
the inscription in which Signor Armellini reads the name of Peter.
But even supposing that it is an inscription, and that Peter's name is
there, it does not prove that Peter baptized there; for, in fact, the
catacomb was made long after S. Peter's death. In the acts of the
martyrs Liberius and Damasus, it is mentioned that in this catacomb
S. Peter baptized (query, not the apostle). This is followed
by Bosio, Aringhi, and De Rossi. This catacomb is supposed to
have belonged to the descendants of Ostorius, the pro-prætor in
Britain who sent Caractacus and his wife prisoners to Claudius. Of
course the simple mention of S. Peter in the inscription does not
prove that he ever was in Rome, for we have every evidence to the
contrary. This catacomb is about two miles outside the Porta
Pia, on the Via Nomentana, and adjoins that of S. Agnese, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
also known by the name of "Peter's Fountain," though there is no
water there. Boldetti informs us that a vial of blood found in the
Ostorian Cemetery bore these words: "<i>Primitius in pace post multas
angustias fortissimus martyr.</i>" This catacomb is also mentioned by
Tertullian.</p>

<p><i>Resuming our ramble</i> along the Via Nomentana, after a short walk
we reach the railway bridge, from which we obtain a beautiful view
of the Campagna and the distant hills, whilst at our feet is the Anio,
spanned by the</p>

<h4>PONTE NOMENTANA,</h4>

<p>a Roman bridge, very picturesque, rebuilt, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 565, by Narses, the
eunuch, and conqueror of Italy. Its present upper part is, however,
medieval. <i>Just beyond is the ridge of</i></p>

<h4>MONS SACER,</h4>

<p>where the plebeians retired when they made their secession, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 492,
and where Menenius Agrippa addressed to them the famous fable of
the "Belly and its Members" (Livy, ii. 32; Dionysius, vi. 86), so
beautifully illustrated by S. Paul: "As the members of a natural
body all tend to the mutual decency, service, and succour of the same
body; so we should do one for another, to make up the mystical
body of Christ" (see 1 Cor. xii.). "They erected an altar upon the
summit of the hill, where they had encamped, which they named the
altar of Jupiter Terribilis" (Dionysius, vi. 90). A second secession
here took place after the death of Virginia, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 449 (Livy, iii. 52).</p>

<p><i>Beyond the osteria</i> (<i>inn</i>), <i>on the left, is the so-called</i></p>

<h4>TOMB OF VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>The shepherds have handed down this tradition, but we have no
historic record of where she was buried. Dionysius (xi. 39) gives
this account of her funeral:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The relatives of the virgin still increased the disaffection of the
citizens by bringing her bier into the forum, by adorning her body
with all possible magnificence, and carrying it through the most
remarkable and most conspicuous streets of the city: for the matrons
and virgins ran out of their houses lamenting her misfortune, and
some threw flowers upon the bier, some their girdles or ribbons
others their virgin toys, and others even cut off their curls and cast
them upon it. And many of the men, either purchasing ornaments
in the neighbouring shops, or receiving them by the favour of the
owners, contributed to the pomp by presents proper to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
occasion: so that the funeral was celebrated through the whole
city."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And close around the body gathered a little train</p>
<p>Of them that were the nearest and dearest to the slain.</p>
<p>They brought a bier, and hung it with many a cypress crown,</p>
<p>And gently they uplifted her, and gently laid her down."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macaulay.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p><i>About three miles from the bridge are the</i></p>

<h4>ORATORY AND CATACOMB OF S. ALEXANDER,</h4>

<p>discovered in 1853. S. Alexander suffered under Trajan, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 117.
In the fourth century a church was built over the oratory and catacomb.
In 1867 Pius IX. laid the foundations of a church to be
erected over these remains. <i>To visit them a permit is necessary
from the cardinal vicar, 70 Via della Scrofa.</i></p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h3>PORTA TIBURTINA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Porta S. Lorenzo.</i>)</p>

<p>This gate was built by Augustus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 3, over the line of the
Pom&oelig;rium, being one of the arches of the Marcian Aqueduct, <span class="s08">B.C.</span>
145. The Aquæ Tepula and Julia likewise passed over it. The inscriptions
refer to Augustus, and to repairs by Vespasian, Caracalla,
and Honorius, who added the picturesque brick towers in 402.</p>

<p><i>A new road has now been made to the</i> <span class="smcap">Cemetery</span>, <i>which is passed by
the tramway to Tivoli. Three quarters of a mile on the road is the</i></p>

<h4>CHURCH OF S. LORENZO,</h4>

<p>founded in 308 by Constantine, in the place where was the cemetery
of S. Cyriaca, which contained the body of S. Lorenzo. It was
enlarged and restored at different periods. Finally, in 1864, Pius
IX. caused the architect Vespignani to make great improvements,
and it was then that the column of red granite with the statue of
the martyr was placed in the adjacent square.</p>

<p>The poet Bishop Vida describes the martyrdom of S. Lawrence,
and thus foretells his monument:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"As circling years revolve, the day shall come</p>
<p>When Troy's great progeny, imperial Rome,</p>
<p>To the blest youth, who, filled with holy pride,</p>
<p>Tyrants, and flames, and bitter death defied,</p>
<p>Shall build full many an altar, many a shrine,</p>
<p>And grace his sepulchre with rites divine."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Under the colonnade, supported by six Ionic columns, and adorned
with frescoes, are two sarcophagi with bas-reliefs; also some curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
frescoes relating to the soul of the Saxon count Henry. The interior
is divided into three aisles by twenty-two columns, the greater part
in Oriental granite. The paving recalls the style of the basilicæ of
the primitive times. The great aisle was painted, by order of Pius
IX., by Cesare Fracassini; in it are two pulpits of marble. A double
staircase of marble conducts to that part of the Basilica Constantiniana
which by Honorius III. was converted into the presbytery.
It is decorated at the upper end by twelve columns of violet
marble, which rise from the level of the primitive basilica beneath
it. At the end is the ancient pontifical seat, adorned with mosaic
and precious marbles. The papal altar is under a canopy in the
Byzantine style. The pavement of the presbytery is worthy of
attention. Descending to the confessional, which is under the
high altar, we find the tomb of the martyred saints&mdash;Lawrence,
Stephen, and Justin. Pius IX. is interred here. Returning to the
church by the staircase on the left, we enter the sacristy, where is
the altar of the Holy Sacrament, with a picture by E. Savonanzio,
representing S. Cyriaca, who is having the martyrs buried. Close
by is the <span class="smcap">Roman Cemetery</span>, opened in 1834. The frescoes here are
worth seeing, as well as the different monuments.</p>

<h4>THE VIA TIBURTINA.</h4>

<p><i>Mr. Forbes's steam-tramway excursion-lecture to Tivoli and Hadrian's
Villa, every Thursday.</i></p>

<p>This road is the worst kept, the least interesting, and the most
frequented out of Rome. The new tramway is now open, so it is
more come-at-able than hitherto. Leaving the cemetery, we soon
pass the Florence railway; then a bridge over the Ulmanus stream.
The farm on the right, inside the gateway, is upon the site of the
Villa of Regulus (Martial, i. 13). At the first mile was the monument
of Pallas (Pliny younger, vii. 29; viii. 6). We soon cross the Anio
by the modern bridge: the old one, Ponte Mammolo, can be seen to
the right; it took its name from Mammæa, the mother of Alexander
Severus, who repaired it. In these meadows Hannibal had his first
camp (see <a href="#Page_288">page 288</a>). Beyond, we pass along the modern causeway
over the meadows where his second camp was, by the Tutia, which
stream we cross. We now pass some of the old pavement, and upon
the left <span class="smcap">Castel Arcione</span>, a medieval castle belonging to a family of
that name; destroyed by the S. P. Q. T., it having become a stronghold
for brigands.</p>

of the <span class="smcap">Aquæ Albulæ</span>, baths often frequented in ancient times.
A channel, constructed by Cardinal Este, draws off the water from
these sulphurous lakes to the Tiber. The bath-house was erected in
1880, and the water is beneficial for skin diseases.</p>

<p>In the vicinity are the quarries of travertine&mdash;so called from the
stone taking the ancient name <i>Tiburtians</i>&mdash;which have yielded the
materials for building both ancient and modern Rome, the Colosseum,
and S. Peter's.</p>

<p><i>Three miles from Tivoli we cross the picturesque</i></p>

<h4>PONTE LUCANO,</h4>

<p>which spans the Anio. Near by is the solid and magnificent Tomb
of the Plautii, similar to that of Cecilia Metella. The upper part
has been repaired in medieval times, that it might serve as a fortress.
Erected, 1 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, by M. Plautius Silvanus for himself, Lartia his wife,
and Urgularicus his child. The inscription tells us that one of his
descendants served in Britain, and died <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 76.</p>

<p><i>A little beyond, a road turns off to the right, leading to Hadrian's

<p><i>First visit the glen at Tivoli, then take the road round to see the small
falls passing over the Ponte dell' Acquoria. Turn to the right. This
brings us into the main road below the town. A short distance down we
turn off to Hadrian's Villa; or, instead of turning to the right after
passing the bridge, the road to the left leads past the Tempio della Tosse
up to the Villa d'Este.</i></p>

<h4>TIVOLI.</h4>

<p><i>Donkey for excursion to the Falls, one and a half lira; guide</i> (<i>not
necessary</i>), <i>one franc.</i></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Albergo Regina</span> is the best in the town; everything clean,
good cookery, and comfortable apartments for those spending a few
days upon the spot. The <span class="smcap">Sibilla</span> not so clean or comfortable, but a
fair lunch can be provided in the Temple of Vesta attached to the
inn. <i>Pension at both houses.</i></p>

<h4>THE VILLA D'ESTE,</h4>

<p><i>near the entrance of the town from Rome, first turning left</i>. It is ornamented
with fountains, ilexes, cypresses, formal plantations and
clipped hedges&mdash;all very stiff amidst so much natural beauty. The
casino is decorated with frescoes by F. Zucchero and Muziano.</p>

<p>The villa has been neglected and deserted by its present proprietor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Cardinal Baroli, and is fast going to ruin and decay: this rather adds
to its picturesque and haunted appearance. If Scott or Dickens had
only made it the scene of one of their tales, it might have become
historical.</p>

<p><i>If your time be limited, omit this villa.</i></p>

</div>

<h4>THE ANCIENT TIBUR</h4>

<p>was delightfully situated on the Sabine Hills. The modern town,
of 7000 inhabitants, has few attractions except its charming situation
and past recollections. It bore the name of Tibur in antiquity,
and during the Augustan age the Roman nobles founded splendid
villas there, among which were those of Augustus himself, Mæcenas,
and the Emperor Hadrian. The beauties of Tivoli and the surrounding
country were recorded in undying verse by Horace, whose Sabine
farm was not far distant, and who seems to have delighted to dwell
in retirement in the neighbourhood rather than in noisy, bustling
Rome. The old town held in high reverence Hercules, the Sibyl,
and Vesta, and the remains of temples dedicated to the latter are
still visible immediately above the cascades on the edge of the
present city limits. It is generally in Vesta's temple that tourists to
the locality spread out and partake of the provisions brought with
them from Rome; this is only advisable in warm weather. This
circular Temple of Vesta is surrounded by an open corridor of
Corinthian columns, ten of which still remain. It was destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
by Lord Bristol, who wanted to carry it off to his estate in
Norfolk.</p>

<a href="images/i-360l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>
<p>The terrace of the temple commands a good view of the falls,
which are formed by the waters of the Anio. A swift torrent, proceeding
from the mountain heights, and leaping down a precipice at
the village, constitutes the celebrated cascades of Tivoli, one of which
is three hundred and forty feet in height. Visitors are conducted to
various spots (on donkeys or on foot) whence they may be able to
catch the finest glimpses of the rising spray, and also in order to visit
the grottoes of Neptune and the Sibyl. The path is often precipitous,
rough, and narrow, but the sight well repays the trouble of parading
over so much ground. Le Cascatelle, or small falls, are formed by a
branch of the Anio. The tunnels through <span class="smcap">Monte Catillo</span> were cut
in 1834, to divert the river, as when it followed the old course the
town was frequently flooded; in fact, the inundation of 1826 rendered
these new channels necessary. This flood exposed the remains
of two ancient bridges and several tombs&mdash;the one higher up the
river, <span class="smcap">Pons Valerius</span>, and the other near the mouth of the tunnels,
<span class="smcap">Pons Vopisci</span>, after the owner of the adjoining ancient villa. The
<span class="smcap">Villa of Mæcenas</span> and <span class="smcap">Temple of Hercules</span> are now occupied by
iron-works; in the garden are remains of a Doric portico. Below the
iron-works is the so-called <span class="smcap">Tempio della Tosse</span>, a circular building
like the Pantheon, probably the tomb of the Turcia family.</p>

<p><i>Having seen the glen at Tivoli, take a donkey round the bank of the
glen over the Ponte Acquoria to the Villa of Hadrian. Man and
donkey, 4 lire.</i></p>

<h4>HADRIAN'S VILLA</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Entrance, one lira</i>)</p>

<p>stands on the slope of the heights of Tivoli, from which it is only
thirty minutes' walk. It once covered an area of several square
miles; and its magnificent grounds, unequalled in the Roman Empire,
were laid out by Hadrian in order to assemble within them
models of everything that had struck him during his travels, and
accordingly they were filled with the finest statuary, palaces, temples,
theatres, circuses, and academies. Some of the finest antique statues
were found here under the popes. All this sumptuousness was
destroyed in the sixth century by the Goths. Extensive ruins still
exist. It is thus described by Pope Pius II.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About the third of a mile from the city of Tivoli, the Emperor
Hadrian built a very splendid villa, like a great village. The lofty
and vast roofs of the temples still remain; the columns of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
peristyles and sublime porticoes may yet be gazed at with admiration.
There are still the remains of the piscinas and baths, where a canal
derived from the Anio once cooled the summer heats.</p>

<p>"Age deforms all things: the ivy now drapes those walls once
covered with painted hangings and cloths woven with gold; thorns and
brambles have grown where purple-clothed tribunes
sat; and snakes inhabit the chambers of queens. Thus
perishable is the nature of all things mortal."</p>

<p><i>Entering</i> through an avenue of cypresses, we arrive
at the <span class="smcap">Odeum</span>, the skeleton of which only remains;
this was for musical performances. <i>Following the
path beyond the modern Casino, to the left</i>, by
the <span class="smcap">Nymphæum</span>, then along the brink of
the valley, we mount up to some chambers,
formerly a reservoir from which
the water poured in a cascade to the
stream Peneas below. <i>From the edge</i>
of this ruin we look down upon a
valley, made in imitation of the
<span class="smcap">Vale of Tempe</span>.
A stream runs
through it, named,
after the river in
Thessaly, <span class="smcap">Peneas</span>.
<i>On the opposite</i> slope
of the valley was the
<span class="smcap">Latin Theatre</span>.
We now enter the
<span class="smcap">Imperial Palace</span>,
with the ruins of
the Temples of
Diana and Venus
adjoining; <i>passing
through which</i>, at the farthest extremity, is the <span class="smcap">Temple of Castor
and Pollux</span>. <i>Near this</i> are some subterranean passages, called the
<span class="smcap">Tartarus</span>. <i>Beyond</i> were the <span class="smcap">Elysian Fields</span>. Elysium, or the
Elysian Fields, was the region where the souls of the dead were
supposed to go to if they had been good. There, happiness was complete,
and the pleasures were innocent and refined; the air was serene
and temperate, the bowers ever green, and the meadows watered with
perennial streams, and the birds continually warbled in the groves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<p>Tartarus was the region of punishment in the nether world of the
ancients. <i>On the farther side</i> of Tartarus is the <span class="smcap">Roman Theatre</span>; <i>beyond</i>
was the <span class="smcap">Lyceum</span>. <i>Returning</i>, we come upon the <span class="smcap">Academy</span>.
The Academy at Athens was an open meadow, given to the city by
Academus, from whom it took its name. It was afterwards formed
into a grove. It was the resort of Plato, and hence his disciples took
the name of <i>academic</i> philosophers.</p>

<p><i>Beyond is the</i> <span class="smcap">Serapeon</span> of <span class="smcap">Canopus</span>, with the <span class="smcap">Sacrarium</span> of
<span class="smcap">Jupiter Serapis</span> at the end, built in imitation of the canal connecting
Alexandria with Canopus, a city of Lower Egypt, twelve
miles east of Alexandria, at the west or Canopic mouth of the Nile.</p>

<p><i>On the right</i> are some remains of the <span class="smcap">Hippodrome</span>; <i>and towards
the</i> entrance of the Serapeon, the <span class="smcap">Baths</span>. <i>From here we reach</i> the
<span class="smcap">Stadium</span>, where the foot races were held. <i>We now come upon</i> a lofty
wall of <i>opus reticulatum</i>, nearly six hundred feet long. This was one
of the walls of the <span class="smcap">Poecile Stoa</span>, in imitation of the grand portico
at Athens of that name, famed for its fresco-paintings of the battle
of Marathon by Polygnotus, and as the seat of the school of Zeno the
philosopher, who took the name Stoic from frequenting this portico.
This portico was built on an artificial platform, and the wall can be
traced all round; <i>underneath</i> are the <span class="smcap">Hundred Chambers</span> of the
<span class="smcap">Guards</span>. <i>From our right</i> of the wall, we enter the <span class="smcap">Prytaneum</span>, in
imitation of the council hall of that name at Athens, where the fifty
deputies of the republic lived and held office, each five weeks in turn.
<i>Through this we reach</i> the <span class="smcap">Aquarium</span>, a circular edifice with an
octagonal platform in the centre, with openings for fountains and
statues; to the left of this were the <span class="smcap">Greek</span> and <span class="smcap">Latin Libraries</span>.</p>

<p>Having now rambled over the extent of this famous villa, and
picked up a memento of our visit, we may truly exclaim&mdash;"<i>Sic
transit gloria mundi.</i>"</p>

<p><i>The tramway back to Rome is taken from the end of the road leading
from the villa.</i></p>

<hr class="l15" />
<h3>PORTA ESQUILINÆ.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Porta Maggiore.</i>)</p>

<p>Here the Via Prænestina diverged from the Labicana; and
Claudius, who was obliged to convey two new streams&mdash;the Aqua
Claudia and the Anio Novus&mdash;over these roads, erected for this purpose
a massive gateway, which spanned both roads at once with a
double arch. This is the splendid monument afterwards taken into
the Aurelian Wall, in the time of Honorius and Arcadius, and converted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
by the erection of a mound in front, into a kind of bulwark.
It now forms one of the city gates, under the name of the Porta
Maggiore.</p>

<p>In each of the three piers supporting the attics with the channels
concealed in the interior is a small gateway, over which a window,
with a gable roof resting on rustic pillars, is introduced. By this
arrangement, not only is a saving of materials effected, but the six
construction arches thus acquired impart a greater degree of stability
to the structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-365" id="i-365"></a>

<a href="images/i-365l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The first inscription on the aqueduct of Claudius mentions the
streams conveyed into the city by the emperor upon these arches.
From it we learn that the water in the channel which bore his name
was taken from two sources,&mdash;the Cæruleus and the Curtius, forty-five
miles off; and that the Anio Novus, which flows above the Aqua
Claudia, was brought hither from a distance of sixty-two miles. The
second inscription relates to the restorations of Vespasian; the third
to those of Titus.</p>

<p>This gateway is the earliest specimen of the rustic style. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
named, by those going out, by which arch they passed through on their
way either to Labicum or to Præneste. Coming in, they called it by
the hill to which they were going. "After I had said that he entered
by the C&oelig;limontane Gate, like a man of mettle he offered to lay a
wager with me that he entered at the Esquiline Gate" (Cicero <i>v.</i>
Piso).</p>

<p>Directly in front of the middle pier of the Porta Maggiore lies a
monument, discovered in the year 1838, on the removal of the mound
referred to. It is</p>

<h4>THE BAKER'S TOMB.</h4>

<p>The man who erected his own monument on this spot was a baker,
who seems to have made a considerable fortune as a purveyor. According
to the good old custom, he was not ashamed of his calling,
but built a species of trophy for himself out of the utensils of the
trade by means of which he had attained to wealth and respectability.
The hollow drums of pillars, for instance, let into the
superstructure, which rests upon double columns, seem to represent
vessels for measuring fruit; and the inscription found beside
them agrees with this opinion, as it states that the mortal remains
of Atistia, the wife of Eurysaces, were deposited in a bread-basket.
In fact, everything was represented that appertained to a baker's
trade.</p>

<p>This is rendered the more interesting from the circumstance of
several of these representations seeming to belong to the present
time&mdash;people in this sphere in Italy usually adhering to the customs
transmitted to them by their forefathers.</p>

<p>The inscription on the architrave, stating this monument to be that
of M. Virgilius Eurysaces, purveyor of bread, is repeated three
times. A relief of the baker and his wife, also the remains of the
Gate of Honorius, are to be seen on the right of the road.</p>

<p>To the north of the tomb three old aqueducts, Marcia, Tepula,
and Julia, can be seen passing through the walls of Rome.</p>

<h4>VIA LABICANA</h4>

<p>is an interesting excursion. <i>Leaving Rome by the Porta Maggiore,
we take the road on the right</i>, <span class="smcap">Via Labicana</span>, <i>as we can return by the
other</i>, <span class="smcap">Via Gabina</span>, or <span class="smcap">Prænestina</span>. For the first mile the road runs
parallel with the Claudian Aqueduct; then, bending to the left, there
are some very picturesque remains of the <span class="smcap">Aqua Hadriana</span>, <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
120, restored by Alexander Severus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 225, as recorded by Spartianus.
At the second mile is <span class="smcap">Tor Pignattara</span>, the so-called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<h4>TOMB OF HELENA (?).</h4>

<p>This ascription is altogether a mistake. Helena was buried in the
city of New Rome (Constantinople), and not outside ancient Rome.
"Her remains were conveyed to New Rome, and deposited in the imperial
sepulchres" (Socrates, E. H., i. 17). The sarcophagus found here
is more likely, from its reliefs, to have been that of a soldier than a
woman. The sarcophagus, of red porphyry, is now in the Hall of the
Greek Cross in the Vatican. The remains of the tomb consist of a
circular hall with eight circular recesses. A church, dedicated to
SS. Peter and Marcellinus, stands within it, beneath which are the
catacombs of these saints. At the sixth mile is <span class="smcap">Torre Nuova</span>, surrounded
by pine and mulberry trees. At the Osteria di Finacchio
(ninth mile) a by-road leads to the Osteria dell'Osa, on the Via Gabina
(two miles). <i>Visitors leave their carriage here, and order it to go two
miles further on, to</i> (<i>opposite</i>) <i>Castiglione, on the Via Prænestina, where
they meet it after visiting</i></p>

<h4>GABII,</h4>

<p>founded by the kings of Alba, and taken by the Romans, under Tarquin,
through the artifice of his son Sextus. It was deserted in the time
of the republic, but recovered under the empire, to fall once more
before the time of Constantine. At the end of the ridge are remains
of the Roman Municipium and Temple of Juno of the time of
Hadrian. The buildings of <span class="smcap">Castiglione</span> occupy the site of the ancient
city. The principal ruin is the <span class="smcap">Temple of Juno Gabina</span>. Virgil tells
us "it was situated amidst rugged rocks, on the banks of the cold
Anienes." The cella is composed of blocks of stone four feet by two
feet; the interior is 50 feet long; the pavement is of white mosaic.
<i>Close by are</i> the ruins of the <span class="smcap">Theatre</span>, and some Ionic columns. Considerable
remains of the ancient walls can be traced. The fresh,
green basin below the ridge was once a lake, and was drained
about twenty-five years since by Prince Borghese. It is curious that
there is no mention of the lake by classical authors. It is first mentioned
in reference to the martyrdom of S. Primitivus, who was beheaded
at Gabii, and whose head was thrown into the lake. This was
in the fifth century. Perhaps the lake did not exist in Tarquin's time,
and was formed by some freak of nature after the desertion of the city.</p>

<p><i>Returning to Rome by the Via Gabina, after passing the stream Osa</i>,
about two miles, we come to a fine Roman viaduct, <span class="smcap">Ponte di Nona</span>,
consisting of seven lofty arches, built of rectangular blocks of <i>lapis
gabinus</i> of the time of the kings. At the eighth mile is the medieval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Tor Tre Teste</span>, so called from the three heads built in its walls.
Here Camillus overtook the Gauls (Livy, v. 49). <i>About two and a
half miles from Rome, at the</i> Tor dei Schiavi, are extensive ruins of
the <span class="smcap">Villa of the Gordian Emperors</span>, consisting of a large reservoir,
the circular hall of the baths, and a circular temple, 43 feet in diameter,
called Apollo. The inside is relieved by alternate round and square
niches; the crypt beneath is supported by one pier. <i>Between this
and</i> Tor dei Schiavi, three rooms at the base of a circular edifice have
been opened; the floors are composed of black and white mosaic.</p>

<p><i>On the right, about a mile further on</i>, is the circular tomb, 50 yards in
diameter, of <span class="smcap">Quintus Atta</span>, the comic poet (<span class="s08">B.C.</span> 55); the interior is in
the form of a Greek cross.</p>

<h3>PORTA S. GIOVANNI.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Mr. Forbes's carriage excursion-lecture at frequent intervals.</i>)</p>

<h3 class="chap1">FIRST EXCURSION.</h3>

<h4>VIA APPIA NOVA.</h4>

<p>This road was made in the time of the Antonines, to relieve the
traffic on the Via Appia, and was called simply a New Way. Several
tombs of the time of the Antonines line it, but none of earlier date.
At the right of the gate is the ancient Porta Asinara, the best preserved
of the brick gates. At the second mile the road is crossed by
the <span class="smcap">Via Latina</span>, <i>turning up which, on the left, we can visit</i></p>

<h4>THE PAINTED TOMBS.</h4>

<p>One, discovered in 1859, is covered with beautiful paintings and
stucco reliefs&mdash;eight landscapes, with groups of men and animals,
with small arabesque borders, beautifully finished. The reliefs on
the vault represent the Trojan War, and figures of Hercules, Chitaredes,
Jupiter, with the eagle and centaurs hunting lions, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Near by</i>, discovered at the same time, is</p>

<h4>THE BASILICA OF S. STEPHEN,</h4>

<p>founded about <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 450 by Demetria, a member of the Anician family.
It was rebuilt by Leo III., <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 800. A bell tower was erected by
Lupus Grigarius about thirty years afterwards. The ground plan can
be easily made out, as also the remains of the altar and baptistery.
In front of the tribune is a vault, entered by stairs, similar to those in
most of the Roman Catholic basilicæ, where the martyrs were buried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
The basilica stands amidst the ruins of a large Roman villa of the
Servilii and Asinii, discovered by Signor Fortunati.</p>

<p><i>Returning to the main road</i>, we soon pass the Tor Fiscali, a medieval
tower, and then the Osteria Tovolato; then we get some fine views of
the ruined aqueducts.</p>

<h4>THE AQUEDUCTS.</h4>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i-369" id="i-369"></a>
<img src="images/i-369.jpg" width="600" height="362" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CLAUDIAN AQUEDUCT.<br />
<a href="images/i-369l.jpg">View larger image.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Sixteen aqueducts supplied the city with water and irrigated the
Campagna. The principal streams were the <span class="smcap">Aqua Appia</span>, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 312;
<span class="smcap">Anio Vetus</span>, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 272; <span class="smcap">Marcia</span>, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 145,&mdash;on the top of its arches,
near Rome, were carried the <span class="smcap">Aquæ Tepula</span> and <span class="smcap">Julia</span>; <span class="smcap">Virgo</span>, <span class="s08">B.C.</span>
21; <span class="smcap">Claudia</span>, with <span class="smcap">Anio Novus</span> above, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 38&ndash;52. The Romans,
finding the water from the Tiber and the wells sunk in the city
unwholesome, built these aqueducts, to bring the water from
the hills that surround the Campagna; but their situation and
purpose rendered them exposed to attack during war, which
partly accounts for their destruction. Four of them still supply
the city with water:&mdash;The <i>Aqua Marcia</i>, which has its source
near Subiaco. From Tivoli it passes through pipes to Rome, which it
enters at the Porta Pia. It was brought in by a company, and
opened by Pius IX. on the 10th of September 1870. The <i>Aqua
Virgo</i>, built by Agrippa, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 21, has its source near the eighth milestone
on the Via Collatina, restored by Nicholas V. It supplies the
Trevi Fountain. The <i>Aqua Alseatina</i>, built by Augustus, <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 10, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
the other side of the Tiber, has its source thirty-five miles from
Rome, at the Lago Baccano. It was restored by Paul V., and supplies
the Pauline Fountain. <i>Acqua Felice</i>, made by Sixtus V., <span class="s08">A.D.</span>
1587. Its source is near La Colonna, formerly the source of Hadrian's
Aqueduct. It runs parallel with the Claudian and the Marcian, near
Rome, in some places being built out of their remains and on their
piers. Pliny says: "If any one will diligently estimate the abundance
of water supplied to the public baths, fountains, fish-ponds,
artificial lakes, and galley-fights, to pleasure-gardens, and to almost
every private house in Rome, and then consider the difficulties
that were to be surmounted, and the distance from which these
streams were brought, he will confess that nothing so wonderful as
these aqueducts can be found in the whole world."</p>

<h4>THE ROUTE.</h4>

<p>We now pass, on the left, a tomb of the Antonines; then an
osteria, on the site of the Temple of Fortuna Muliebris, where Coriolanus
was over-persuaded by his wife and mother. On our right is a
ruined aqueduct, which supplied the Villa of the Quintilii, whose
picturesque ruins we have previously passed.</p>

<p>We now soon reach the ascent to Albano, and strike the old
Appian Way at Frattocchie, where Clodius was murdered by Milo.
(See Cicero <i>pro</i> Milo.) At the twelfth mile, <i>on the right</i>, are the
ruins of Bovillæ. Several unknown tombs line the road. At the intersection
of the Via Appia with the town limits stands an ancient
tomb, formerly considered to be that of the Horatii and Curiatii,
those champions of their age. Now it is more correctly held to be</p>

<h4>THE TOMB OF POMPEY THE GREAT.</h4>

<p>For we know from Plutarch that his ashes were carried to Cornelia,
who buried them in his land near Alba, though Lucan (viii. 835)
complains that he had no tomb&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And thou, O Rome, by whose forgetful hand</p>
<p>Altars and temples, reared to tyrants, stand,</p>
<p>Canst thou neglect to call thy hero home,</p>
<p>And leave his ghost in banishment to roam?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The town occupies the site of the ruins of the Villa of Pompey, and
the Albanum of Domitian. The best view of the Mediterranean is
to be had at</p>

<h4>ALBANO,</h4>

<p><i>reached by rail in one hour from Rome</i>. It is a favourite resort
in summer, on account of its pure air, elevated position, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
delightful rambles that can be made in its neighbourhood. In
winter it is frequented by all the Forestieri, who are to be
seen there daily in carriages and on donkeys, doing all the attractions
of the locality. From this point the tour of the Alban Hills,
taking in all places of interest, can be most conveniently made. The
peasants' costumes are very attractive. The town itself is not a centre
of interest; a few ruins are shown in some of its streets, but they are
neither very visible nor authentic.</p>

<h4>VALE OF ARICCIA.</h4>

<p>In the ascent to the town from the station, on the right is a
beautiful valley, once a lake, but now drained, called the Vale of
Ariccia. It is not known when it was drained. It is thus alluded to
by Ovid ("Fasti," iii. 263):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Deep in Ariccia's vale, and girt around</p>
<p>With shady trees, a sacred lake is found;</p>
<p>Here Theseus' son in safe concealment lay,</p>
<p>When hurried by the violent steeds away."</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Passing through the town</i>, we come to the Viaduct of Pius IX.
(1846&ndash;1863).</p>

<p>Just before reaching the viaduct, the old Appian Way branches
off to the right, descending the side of the Vale of Ariccia. Several
remains of tombs exist at this point, notably that of Aruns, the
son of Porsena of Clusium.</p>

<h4>TOMB OF ARUNS.</h4>

<p>This ruin agrees exactly with the lower part of the Tomb of Porsena
at Clusium, described by Pliny (xxxvi. 19). He says: "But
as the fabulousness of the story connected with it quite exceeds
all bounds, I shall employ the words given by M. Varro himself in
his account of it. 'Porsena was buried,' says he, 'beneath the city of
Clusium, in the spot where he had constructed a square monument,
built of squared stones. Each side of this monument was 300 feet
long and 50 feet high, and beneath the base, which was also square,
was an inextricable labyrinth.... Above this square building there
stood five pyramids&mdash;one at each corner and one in the middle&mdash;75
feet broad at the base and 150 feet in height,'" &amp;c.</p>

<p>The present ruin is 49 feet long on each side and 24 feet high,
surmounted at the angles with four cones, and one larger, in the
centre, 26 feet in diameter, in which the urn was found in the last
century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<h4>ARICCIA.</h4>

<p>The ancient ascent to Ariccia was the Clivus Virbii, so called from
Hippolytus, who, on being restored to life by Diana, took the name
of Virbius.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"But Trivia kept in secret shades alone</p>
<p>Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;</p>
<p>And called him Virbius in the Egerian Grove,</p>
<p>Where then he lived obscure, but safe from Jove."</p>

<p class="i12"><span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, <i>Æneid</i>, vii. 774.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The ascent was a noted place for beggars, as recorded by Persius
(Sat. vi. 55) and Juvenal (Sat. iv.).</p>

<p>The village is three-quarters of a mile west from Albano, surrounded
by beautiful woods. At its entrance is the Palazzo Chigi,
built by Bernini, in the midst of a fine park; fee, half-franc. The
ancient town lay lower down the hill, where some of its remains can
still be traced. Horace (Lib. i. Sat. 5) tells us that for slow travellers
it was the first halting-place from Rome.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the vale, just under the town, was the</p>

<h4>TEMPLE OF DIANA ARICINA,</h4>

<p>which Vitruvius (iv. 7) says was circular. The story of this temple
is given by several classic writers. "Hippolytus came into Italy and
dedicated the Temple of Aricina Diana. In this place, even at present,
those who are victors in a single contest have the office of
priest to the goddess given to them as a reward. This contest, however,
is not offered to any free person, but only to slaves who have
fled from their masters" (Pausanias, ii. 27). In 1791 a relief representing
the scene was found at the circular ruin, and is now at Palma
in Majorca. The temple was near a little stream from a source under
the second viaduct, known as the</p>

<h4>FOUNTAIN OF EGERIA,</h4>

<p>which supplies the lake. The nymph was overcome by the death of
Numa, as Ovid tells us: "Other woes, however, did not avail to
diminish Egeria's grief; and, lying down at the very foot of the
mountain, she melted into tears, until the sister of Apollo (Diana),
moved to compassion, made a cool fountain of her body, changed into
perennial waters."

</div></div>

<p>After two miles of a picturesque and shady road, crossing four
viaducts, and commanding beautiful views, we arrive at</p>

<h4>GENZANO.</h4>

<p>Its excellent wine is renowned, and this, together with its flowers
and beautiful situation, are its sole attractions. The flower festival,
held the eighth day after Corpus Christi, is fully described in "The
Improvisatore." <i>Up a path</i> by the side of the Palazzo Cesarini we
obtain a fine view of the</p>

<h4>LAKE NEMI,</h4>

<p>which occupies an extinct crater. The lake is three miles in circumference,
and 300 feet deep, and passes out by an artificial <i>emissarium</i>,
made by Trajan. The water is calm and marvellously clear.</p>

<p>Trajan erected on this lake a floating palace, 500 feet in length,
270 feet in breadth, and 60 feet deep. It was of wood, joined with
bronze nails, and lead plated outside; the inside was lined with
marble, and the ceilings were of bronze. The water for use and ornament
was supplied from the Fount Juturna by means of pipes.
Signor Marchi, a Roman, in 1535 descended in a diving-bell and explored
this curious palace, which had sunk beneath the waters. He
left an account of his discoveries. (See Brotier's "Tacitus," Sup.
Ap., and Notes on Trajan.) A large fragment of the wood-work is
preserved in the Kircherian Museum.</p>

<p><i>On the opposite side</i> is the small medieval town of</p>

<h4>NEMI,</h4>

<p>picturesquely situated upon a hill above the lake. On the sides of
the lake are the remains of villas built of <i>opus reticulatum</i>; and in
the sixteenth century some of the wood-work, tiles, &amp;c., of Cæsar's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Villa&mdash;begun, but afterwards pulled down because it did not suit his
taste&mdash;were found, and are preserved in the Library of the Vatican.</p>

</div></div>

<h4>THE TEMPLE OF DIANA NEMORENSE.</h4>

<p>On the plateau at the east end of the lake, to our left of Nemi, his
excellency Sir John Savile Lumley, the British ambassador, has
recently made some most interesting excavations&mdash;uncovering the
vast area of the Temple of Diana at Nemi, and at the same time
discovering numerous objects of interest, which proved without
doubt to whom the shrine was dedicated.</p>

<p>The front of the temple was formed with a portico of fluted columns,
and its rear was towards the lake, so the temple faced east. The whole
Artemisium shows traces of many restorations, not the least interesting
being that made by Marcus Servilius Quartus, consul <span class="s08">A.D.</span> 3,
whose tomb is on the Via Appia (Tacitus, "A." ii. 48; iii. 22).</p>

<p>When Iphigenia, priestess of the Temple of Diana at Tauris in the
Crimea, fled with her brother Orestes, they carried off the statue of
Diana, to whom all strangers cast on the coast were sacrificed, and
founded a temple near the Lake of Diana, now Nemi, on the Alban
Hills (Ovid, "Ep." iii. 2; "Met." xv. 485). "The temple is in a
grove, and before it is a lake of considerable size. The temple and
water are surrounded by abrupt and lofty precipices, so that they
seem to be situated in a deep and lofty ravine" (Strabo, v. 3, 12).</p>

<h4>THE FOUNTAIN OF JUTURNA.</h4>

<p>This issues from the hill under the village, and serves the mill on
the border of the lake. "Tell me, nymph Juturna, thou that wast
wont to minister to the grove and looking-glass of Diana" (Ovid,
"F." iii. 260). "The springs by which the lake is filled are visible.
One of them is denominated Juturna, after the name of a certain
divinity" (Strabo v. 3, 12).</p>

<p><i>A ramble through the woods brings us to the adjoining lake at
Palazzolo</i>, which is generally seen in the distance from the opposite
side of the lake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<h4>PALAZZOLO.</h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And near, Albano's scarce divided waves</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>Situated on Lake Albano, or it may be reached from Albano or Marino
by other roads passing round the Lake Albano.</i> It is a Franciscan
monastery. In its gardens is a tomb supposed to be that of
Cneius Cornelius Scipio Hispanus, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 176.</p>

<p><i>A path through the woods leads up to Monte Cavo.</i></p>

<h4>THE ALBAN LAKE</h4>

<p>is 150 feet below Lake Nemi. Its outlet conducts its waters to the
Tiber. This lake also occupies the crater of an extinct volcano; it is
six miles round, and of unknown depth. The outlet was made at
the time the Romans were besieging Veii, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 394, to lower the
waters which threatened to flood the Campagna. It is 1509 yards
in length.</p>

<p><i>Situated on the bluff overlooking the lake is</i></p>

<h4>CASTEL GANDOLFO,</h4>

<p>formerly the summer residence of the popes. Its palace was erected
by Urban VIII. This palace, and the charming situation, are its
only features of attraction.</p>

<p><i>On the opposite shore, which can be reached either from Palazzolo, or
by a path from the Albano or the Marino end of the lake, is the supposed

<h4>ALBA LONGA.</h4>

<p>Built by Ascanius 1152 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, destroyed by Tullus Hostilius 666 <span class="s08">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Virgil tells us that on Æneas consulting the oracle at Delos, the
oracle replied,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,</p>
<p>And bear them safely treasured in thy breast:</p>
<p>When, in the shady shelter of a wood,</p>
<p>And near the margin of a gentle flood,</p>
<p>Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,</p>
<p>With thirty sucking young encompassed round,</p>
<p>The dam and offspring white as falling snow,&mdash;</p>
<p>These on thy city shall their name bestow,</p>
<p>And there shall end thy labours and thy woe."</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Æneid</i>, iii. 388.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Again, when Father Tiber appeared to him, he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And that this mighty vision may not seem</p>
<p>Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>
<p>A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,</p>
<p>All white herself, and white her thirty young.</p>
<p>When thirty rolling years have run their race,</p>
<p>Thy son Ascanius, on <i>this</i> empty space,</p>
<p>Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,</p>
<p>Which from this omen shall receive the name."</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Æneid</i>, viii. 70.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Again, after Father Tiber had disappeared, and Æneas, having
invoked the god, fitted out two galleys to go up the Tiber to
Evander:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.</p>
<p>Wondrous to tell, she lay along the ground;</p>
<p>Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung&mdash;</p>
<p>She white herself, and white her thirty young!"</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Æneid</i>, viii. 120.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, according to Virgil's own showing, the sow was found on
the banks of the Tiber; how then could the shores of the Alban Lake
be the site of Alba Longa? Ought we not rather to look for that
site on the banks of the Tiber below Rome, where the sow was
found, according to the voices of the oracle and the river-god, and
the record handed down by Virgil? On the other hand, we are told
Alba Longa was "built by Ascanius, the son of Æneas, thirty years
after the building of Lavinium. Alba stood between a mountain and
a lake: the mountain is extremely strong and high, and the lake deep
and large. When one part of the lake is low upon the retreat of the
water, and the bottom clear, the ruins of porticoes and other traces
of habitation appear, being the remains of the palace of King
Alladius, which was destroyed by the lake rising. Alba Longa was
demolished by Marcus Horatius, by command of Tullus Hostilius"
(Dionysius, i. 66. See Livy, i. 29).</p>

<p>From Castel Gandolfo a pleasant road by the lake leads to Marino,
<i>passing through a wood</i> after leaving the lake. <i>Just before entering</i>
the town we come to a wooded glen, the ancient</p>

<h4>VALLIS FERENTINA,</h4>

<p>where the diet of the Latin states assembled to discuss the interests
of peace and war. A stream runs through the valley, and in the spring
which feeds the stream, at the head of the valley, Turnus Herdonius,
Lord of Ariccia, was drowned by the command of Tarquinius Superbus.</p>

<h4>MARINO,</h4>

<p>celebrated for its wine, is perched on an eminence 1730 feet high.
It was a great stronghold of the Orsini, and afterwards of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Colonnas, whose towers and palace still stand. The principal street
is the Corso. At the top, on the right hand side, is a house decorated
with curious mosaics and bas-reliefs, surmounted with a Madonna.
At the bottom of the Corso is the Cathedral of S. Barnabas, in
which is a picture of S. Bartholomew, by Guercino. The fountain
close by is picturesque, composed of half female figures supporting
the basin, out of which four figures rise supporting a column.</p>

<p><i>Over a beautiful route of four miles we reach</i></p>

<h4>GROTTA FERATTA, AND CICERO'S TUSCULAN VILLA,</h4>

<p>which is now a Greek monastery, founded in 1002 by S. Ninus. In
one of its chapels are frescoes from the life of the saint, by Domenichino,
restored by Camuccini in 1819. Fairs are held here on the
28th of March and 8th of September, drawing large crowds from the
neighbourhood as well as from Rome.</p>

<p>The villa stands on the site and is built out of the remains of Cicero's
Villa, which he purchased of Sylla the dictator at a great price. To
the south of the hill upon which the villa stands is a deep dell, falling
into which is the stream of the Aqua Craba, mentioned by Cicero,
now called the Maranna or running stream; and the plane-tree
still flourishes here as it did in his day. Cicero likewise mentions that
he had statues of the muses in his library, and a hermathena in his
academy, and these statues were actually found here. The scenes
of his "De Divinatione" and "Tusculan Disputations" were laid here.
They were not addressed to any public assembly, but he used to
retire after dinner to his so-called academy, and invited his guests
to call for the subject they wished explained, which became the
argument of the debate. These five discussions or conferences he
collected and published as the "Tusculan Disputations" after the
name of his villa, which was in the Tusculan territory, but not at the
city itself. The subjects were,&mdash;Contempt of Death; On Bearing
Pain; Grief of Mind; Other Perturbations of the Mind; Whether
Virtue be Sufficient for a Happy Life. It was here that he received
news of his proscription.</p>

<p>A pleasant drive soon brings us to the foot of the hills, passing
on our way several tombs, and the ruined castle of the Savellis, a
medieval stronghold of the tenth century, called <span class="smcap">Borghetto</span>, of
which only the outer walls are standing. Two miles below, <i>on our
right</i>, are the ruins of an immense reservoir of the aqueducts coming
from the Alban Hills, the <span class="smcap">Tepula</span>, 126 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>; the <span class="smcap">Julia</span>, 34 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>;
and the <span class="smcap">Severiana</span>, 190 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> It is known by the name of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Centroni</span>. Just below the bluff on which it stands, the stream of
the Aqua Craba, coming from Rocca di Papa, falls into the Almo
coming from Marino; united, they flow through an old tunnel under
the road beyond the bridge.</p>

<p><i>We now strike the Via Tusculana or Frascati Road.</i></p>

<p><i>On the left</i> are the picturesque ruins of the <span class="smcap">Villa of Septimius
Bassus</span>, consul 317 <span class="s08">A.D.</span> It is known by the name of Sette Bassi,
or Roma Vecchia. Part of the villa is of the time of Hadrian.
About two miles further on, <i>on our right</i>, is a tumulus, Monte del
Grano, in which was found the splendid sarcophagus now in the
Capitoline Museum, which contained the Portland Vase. It is not
known to whom it belonged. We next cross the Naples railway,
and pass under <span class="smcap">Porta Furba</span> (Thieves' Arch), supporting the Acqua
Felice. Looking back through the arch, there is a beautiful view.
Here we can see the arches of the aqueducts distinctly: <i>on the left</i>,
under the arch by the fountain, the Claudia and Anio Novus; and
<i>on the right</i> the Marcia, Tepula, and Julia. The stream in sight is
the Maranna. From here the lane to the right, a pleasant drive,
leads to the Porta Maggiore, whilst that straight on strikes the Via
Appia Nova, near the Porta S. Giovanni.</p>

<h3>SECOND EXCURSION.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Mr. Forbes's excursion by rail and donkeys at frequent intervals.</i>)</p>

<p>To return, we take the road above, to the point where the Grotta
Feratta road strikes off to the right; then the road ascends to
Frascati; but there is nothing of interest <i>en route</i>. Much time is
saved by taking the rail to Frascati, which brings us into the
town, near the Piazza and Cathedral.</p>

<h4>FRASCATI,</h4>

<p>of all the Alban towns, is most frequented, on account of its proximity
to Rome, from which it can be reached by rail in half-an-hour. The
town itself is uninteresting. In the cathedral is a monument to
Prince Charles Edward, erected by his brother, the Cardinal York,
who was bishop of this diocese.</p>

<p>The beautiful villas in the vicinity are well worth visiting, affording
cool retreats in summer. These are, Villa Montalto; Villa
Pallavicini; Villa Conti; Villa Borghese; Villa Ruffinella; Villa
Muti, long the residence of Cardinal York; Villa Sora; Villa Falconieri;
Villa Angelotti; and Villa Mondragone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span></p>

<p><i>On the road to</i> Monte Porzio, <i>viâ</i> Manara, under the town, is the
pretty little Villa Sansoni, once the residence of the Chevalier S. George,
the would-be King James III. of England and VIII. of Scotland.</p>

<p>The antiquities of Frascati are few. <i>In walking up from</i> the
station, opposite the hospital, in a garden, is a grotto called the
<span class="smcap">Nymphæum of Lucullus</span>; and in a piazza, where the donkeys are
usually mounted for Tusculum, is a circular tomb called the Sepulchre
of Lucullus. Lucullus distinguished himself in the Social War.
He was consul 74 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, and for seven years conducted the war
against Mithridates. He died 56 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, and was buried by his
brother on his estate at Tusculum,&mdash;the offer of a public funeral in
the Campus Martius being declined. "Lucullus had the most
superb pleasure house in the country near Tusculum; adorned with
grand galleries and open saloons, as well for the prospect as for
walks" (Plutarch). <i>Opposite</i> the house of the Chevalier S. George
are some remains of a villa of the time of Augustus.</p>

<p><i>In ascending the hill from</i> Frascati, we pass along by a shady road,
passing through the Villa Ruffinella (the property of Prince Angelotti,
who has made a new road up to it). Under the porch are
some remains brought from Tusculum.</p>

<h4>TUSCULUM.</h4>

<p>A city of great antiquity, now in ruins, founded by the son of Ulysses.
The remains of the forum, reservoir, and walls can still be traced.
The ancient citadel stood on the artificial rock, which is now surmounted
by a cross, 212 feet above the city. The view is magnificent.
The height is 2400 feet above the sea. Tusculum was destroyed
in 1191, after repeated attacks by the Romans, who razed it to the
ground. It was the birthplace of Cato. Ascending by the old road,
still paved with the blocks of lava stone, passing by an old tomb, we
arrive at the amphitheatre of reticulated work, 225 feet by 167 feet
broad. The construction shows it to be of the time of Hadrian.
Above, some massive remains of the same construction have been
dignified by some as the site of Cicero's Villa. We have thoroughly
explored these remains, and proved them to form a large reservoir for
water, of the time of Hadrian. Beyond was the Forum, the Diurnal
Theatre, the Reservoir, and the Citadel. To the left, before entering
the theatre, a short distance down the old road, is a fountain erected
by the ædiles Q. C. Latinus and Marcus Decimus, by order of the
senate. Near it is a reservoir with a roof like a Gothic arch, formed
in the primitive style of one stone resting against another. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
here a specus runs back into the hill to the spring. Here also can
be examined the walls of the city, formed of square blocks of
sperone, evidently rebuilt at a later date, as the walls to the left in
the ditch are polygonal, agreeing with the date of the city. The
hill of Tusculum is formed of volcanic matter, which has in some
parts been so hardened as to form a stone, <i>sperone lapis Tusculanus</i>,
and which, from the condition of the ruins, must have been largely
used in the buildings of the city.</p>

<p>The visitor who has come up from Frascati, and wishes to return
there, had better do so by another path through the woods, by the
Camaldoli Monastery, to the Villa Mondragone, then by the Villa
Borghese to Frascati, a pleasant route. From Tusculum, a charming
path through the chestnut groves leads up to Monte Cavo, avoiding
Rocca di Papa, the ancient Fabia, which can be seen on the return.</p>

<h4>ROCCA DI PAPA</h4>

<p>is situated on the brink of the great crater which, the natives say,
was formerly occupied by the camp of Hannibal. Fabius kept the
hills, and Hannibal the plain. It takes its name from the proprietors,
Annibile, and had nothing to do with Hannibal. It is a
small town, but well suited for a summer residence. <i>From here we
ascend to</i></p>

<h4>MONTE CAVO.</h4>

<p>The ascent is made in three-quarters of an hour. There is a wooded
ascent along the Via Triumphalis, by which the Roman generals ascended
in order to celebrate at the Temple of Jupiter Latialis. The
ruins of this temple were converted partly into a monastery by the
Cardinal York, and partly into the Church of S. Peter's at Frascati.
The ancient name of this mountain was Monte Latialis, and the
ancient road that went over it, Via Numinis, the initials V. N. in
the pavement telling us the name. It is 3200 feet above the sea.
About three parts of the way up, from a ledge off the road, a
beautiful view of the Alban Lakes can be had&mdash;forming, as it were, a
pair of eyes. The view obtained is unequalled, comprising the sea
and coast from Terracina and Civita Vecchia, Rome and the Campagna,
and, immediately beneath us, the Alban Mountains&mdash;one of
the most interesting views in the world, every spot around being
full of historical associations. Here, as it were, we can take in the
whole panoramic view of the history of Rome. The surface of the
mountain, on which stood the shrine of the god, extends to three
thousand square yards. Besides its religious and architectural purposes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
this area was used as a collector for rain water, which first
ran into a <i>piscina limaria</i> to be purified, and then through a subterranean
channel to a reservoir, the capacity of which amounts to one
thousand cubic yards, having still some hydraulic regulators of lead,
with their keys and pipes, on which the names of Maximus and
Tubero, consuls in 11 <span class="s08">B.C.</span>, are engraved.</p>

<p>The return journey is made down the direct road from Rocca di Papa
to Frascati, passing the <span class="smcap">Ponte degli Squarciarelli</span>, over the Aqua
Craba, at the point where the roads turn off to Marino, Grotta Feratta,
and Frascati.</p>

<hr class="l15" />
<h3>PORTA OSTIENSIS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Porta S. Paolo.</i>)</p>

<p>This is the most picturesque of the gates of Rome. It consists of
a double gateway, the outer (of the time of Theodoric) with one, the
inner (of the time of Claudius) with two arches, flanked with towers.</p>

<p><i>On the right is the</i></p>

<h4>PYRAMID OF CAIUS CESTIUS,</h4>

<p>erected by his heir, Pontius Mela, and his freedman Pothus. This
imposing structure was faced with smoothly hewn slabs of marble,
and stands on a basement of travertine measuring 95 feet in diameter.
It is 115 feet high.</p>

<p>This monument, erected some twenty or thirty years before the
Christian era, was indebted for its preservation to the circumstance
of its having been incorporated by Aurelian with the line of his fortifications.
The confined burial chamber (the paintings on the roof and
walls of which are now almost obliterated) is reached through the
doorway, introduced at some height on the north side. As is usually
the case with tombs, in order to prevent spoliation, there were no
steps leading up to the door. The west entrance is of more modern
origin, dating from the time of Alexander VII., who caused it to be
broken through the wall, although the ancient original doorway already
afforded the means of ingress. The lower portion of the monument
was cleared from the rubbish, which had accumulated to the height of
twenty feet, at the same time; and the two fluted columns, resting
upon travertine bases, were also dug up. Still more remarkable is the
discovery of the remains of the colossal statue of C. Cestius, consisting
of the foot and arm, now in the Hall of Bronzes in the Capitol Museum.</p>

<p><i>Keeping the straight road, we come, on the left, to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CHAPEL OF SS. PETER AND PAUL.</h4>

<p>A relief over the door represents their parting, where this chapel
now stands. The inscription says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotc">
<p>IN THIS PLACE SS. PETER AND PAUL SEPARATED ON THEIR WAY TO MARTYRDOM.<br />
AND PAUL SAID TO PETER, "PEACE BE WITH THEE, FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH,<br />
SHEPHERD OF THE FLOCK OF CHRIST."<br />
AND PETER SAID TO PAUL, "GO IN PEACE, PREACHER OF GOOD TIDINGS, AND<br />
GUIDE OF THE SALVATION OF THE JUST."</p>
</div>

<h4>THE CHURCH OF S. PAOLO.</h4>

<p>The first church built, in the time of Constantine, to commemorate
the martyrdom of S. Paul. It was destroyed by fire on July 15,
1823; its restoration was immediately commenced, and it was reopened
in 1854 by Pio Nono. The festa days are January 25th,
June 30th, and December 28th. The principal entrance towards
the Tiber is still unfinished. Before the Reformation it was under
the protection of the kings of England. It is the finest of Roman
churches, and the visitor cannot fail to be charmed with its beauty;
it is one vast hall of marble, with eighty Corinthian pillars forming
the nave, reflected in the marble pavement. The grand triumphal
arch which separates the nave from the transept is a relic of the old
basilica; and the mosaic, Christ blessing in the Greek manner, with
the twenty-four elders, is of the fifth century, given by Placidia,
sister of Honorius, in 440. The mosaic of the tribune was erected
by Pope Honorius III., 1216&ndash;27; it has been restored since the fire.
On either side are statues of S. Peter and S. Paul; around the
church, above the columns, are portraits of the popes, from S. Peter,
in mosaics. The altar canopy is supported by four pillars of Oriental
alabaster, given by Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt. A marble staircase
leads to the subterranean chapel, where are preserved the relics
of the martyrs Paul and Timothy. The altars at each end of the
transept are of malachite, given by the Czar of Russia. The painted
windows are worthy of attention, as also a beautiful alabaster
candelabrum saved from the fire. The walls and numerous chapels
are adorned with paintings and statues of the present day, giving a
good idea of the actual state of art in Rome. By applying for the
key in the sacristy, visitors can see the beautiful court of the
thirteenth century, which will fully repay inspection.</p>

<p>Prudentius, who saw the original basilica in its glory, thus describes
it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Imperial splendour all the roof adorns;</p>
<p>Whose vaults a monarch built to God. and graced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>
<p>With golden pomp the vast circumference.</p>
<p>With gold the beams he covered, that within</p>
<p>The light might emulate the beams of morn.</p>
<p>Beneath the glittering ceiling pillars stood</p>
<p>Of Parian stone, in fourfold ranks disposed:</p>
<p>Each curving arch with glass of various dye</p>
<p>Was decked; so shines with flowers the painted mead</p>
<p>In spring's prolific day."</p>

<p class="i12"><i>Passio Beat. Apost.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>This description will apply equally well to the present basilica. The
church is 396 feet long from the steps of the tribune; width of aisle
and nave, 222 feet.</p>

<p>The façade of the basilica, the upper part of which has lately been
uncovered, is toward the Tiber; it consists of a beautiful mosaic
which has taken thirteen years to complete, and is the finest production
of the Vatican manufactory. The whole is surmounted by a
cross, under which are the words <i>Spes Unica</i>; below it is our Lord
enthroned, with SS. Peter and Paul on either side below the steps of
his throne. A scene symbolic of the New Testament is below. A
rock occupies the centre, from which flow the four rivers of the
Apocalypse; on the summit is the Lamb supporting the cross. The
cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem are on each side, whilst flocks of
sheep between the palm-trees are symbolic of the apostolic college.
Below, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel typify the Old Testament.
The whole, a triangle, is bordered with a mosaic of fruit and
foliage.</p>

<p><i>At the back of the church is</i></p>

<h4>THE REMURIA HILL.</h4>

<p>It is altogether a mistake to suppose that Remus took his stand
upon the Aventine and Romulus upon the Palatine; if so, they
would both have commanded nearly the same horizon, and messengers
need not have been sent from one to the other to tell the number
of birds seen. Romulus stood on the Aventine, and Remus on
the hill before us, the Remuria.</p>

<p>"Remus pitched upon the ground now called from him Remuria.
This place is very proper for a city, being a hill not far from
the Tiber, distant from Rome about thirty stadia" (Dionysius,
i. 85).</p>

<p>"Romulus buried Remus at Remuria, since, when alive, he had
been fond of building there" (<i>Ibid.</i>, i. 87).</p>

<p>This hill is called to the present day <i>La Remuria</i>.</p>

<p><i>The road straight on past S. Paolo leads to the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<h4>TRE FONTANE,</h4>

<p>or Three Springs, which are said to have sprung forth when S. Paul
was executed on this spot, his head rebounding three times after it
was cut off. Three churches have been built here, but they are not
of much interest.</p>

<p><i>The rambler can return to the city from S. Paul's by tramway, fare
six sous, to the Piazza Montanara.</i></p>

<p><i>To the left the</i> <span class="smcap">Strada delle Sette Chisse</span> <i>leads to the</i> <span class="smcap">Via Appia</span>,
<i>near the Church of S. Sebastiano.</i></p>

<h4>THE VIA OSTIENSIS.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Mr. Forbes's carriage excursion at frequent intervals.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Instead of turning to the left to the Three Fountains, keep straight on.</i>
This is the pleasantest and prettiest road out of Rome, but the views
are not so commanding as on some others. On the hill to the left
was the Vicus Alexandrinus, where the Lateran obelisk was landed;
at Tor di Valle we cross the stream that comes from the Vallis Ferentina,&mdash;the
bridge is of the time of the kings; then the Rivus
Albanus, the outlet of Lake Albano; we next cross the Decima
stream; beyond, the Via Laurentina, at the Osteria of Malafede,
turns off to the <i>left</i>. We descend to the valley of the Malafede,
which is still crossed by the</p>

<h4>VIADUCT OF ANCUS MARTIUS,</h4>

<p>called <i>Ponte della Refolta</i>. It is worth while to get out of the carriage
here and turn into the field at the gate on the left, over the
bridge, to see this piece of ancient work, formed of great blocks of
tufa stone of the time of the kings, having some repairs in <i>opus reticulatum</i>
of the republic. The paved arch over the stream is in good
preservation, and is older than the Cloaca Maxima, but not so well
known. It is evidently the work of Ancus Martius, who made the
port of Ostia, and consequently the road to get there. At the top
of the hill above we get the first view of the sea and the last of
S. Peter's. We now pass through the woods and along an ancient
causeway through the salt marshes to the modern village of</p>

<h4>OSTIA,</h4>

<p>fourteen miles from Rome. The ancient remains are beyond. Founded
by Ancus Martius, it was the great port and arsenal of ancient Rome,
with which it rose and fell. <i>Ascending</i> the tower of the castle in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
village, an extensive view of the Latin coast and the surrounding
ancient forests may be had. Several rooms in the castle have been
turned into a museum of fragments found in the excavations. The
castle was built by Julius II., 1503&ndash;13; and besides this there is
nothing of interest in the miserable village. The Street of Tombs
leads to the ancient city. The principal objects of interest are the
Porta Romana and Guardhouse, houses in the city, tombs and columbaria,
Temple of Cybele, the Temple of Vulcan, street with portico
and warehouses, the Horrea with the Dolia, the Imperial Palace, baths
containing many beautiful specimens of mosaic pavement, Temple of
Mithras, in which the altar is still standing, the Arsenal, &amp;c.</p>

</div>
<p>The recent excavations were commenced at Ostia at the close of
1870 upon a system more in accordance with the requirements of
archæological science and the tendencies of topographical discoveries
than had up to that time been practised. All idea of speculating&mdash;as
had been until then the chief aim of the popes&mdash;in the statues and
precious objects that might be found, was renounced, and instead it
was proposed to uncover, by steady and continued effort, the ruins
of the buried edifices; especial attention was bestowed upon those
along the banks of the Tiber, as they had played an important part
in the career of the city. The earth was first removed round the
large edifice known as the "Imperial Palace," bordering on the Tiber;
its principal entry, upon the bank of the river, although decorated
with a more elegant front, constituted only a common doorway.
Three spots, which bore the aspect of stairs leading down to the
river, have been excavated: firstly, upon the line from the Temple
of Vulcan to the river; secondly, at a basin to the right side of this
line; thirdly, at the other extremity of the basin, adjoining the
Imperial Palace. At the first point was found the street which terminated
at the banks of the river with a flight of steps. Upon
removing the soil, a street was discovered paved with immense flagstones,
fifteen yards wide, including the porticoes that flanked it on
both sides. The porticoes are six yards wide, and are built with
pillars of arched brick, decorated at the lower extremity with bas-reliefs,
and at the upper with cornices of terra-cotta, lace design. In
their interior are large compartments for warehouses, with a depth
of six yards below the level of the pavement. This street leading
from the river to the Temple of Vulcan is one hundred and
fifty yards long. The lateral walls subsist up to the height of
seven yards, and the rooms of the porticoes still preserve their ceilings,
the pavement of the first floor being mosaic. Another street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
parallel to the above, was struck at the second point, also running
from the river, and paved with large flagstones; it has a width of
five yards, and on each side large warehouses. On the left side are
a series of pillars adorned with cornices, having a height of seven
yards, and a lateral width of two yards. As the street advances into
the city, along the entire course are shops and warehouses, conveying
the grandest idea of the life, activity, and commercial traffic that
must have prevailed in the city. At the third spot were found the
traces of a large stairway, leading to a terrace reared above the level
of the river. To this stairway two streets lead, the first six yards
wide, and proceeding from the interior of the city; the second,
ten yards, running parallel to the Tiber, each side being occupied
with warehouses. These are the three main streets lately thoroughly
uncovered and examined, and which, while affording an accurate
plan to modern eyes of the time-honoured city, unite, with its other
ruins, tombs, and mosaic pavements, to make Ostia one of the wonders
of the day.</p>

<h4>CASTEL FUSANO</h4>

<p>is a seat of Prince Chigi, two miles to the left of modern Ostia, just
inside the pine-forest. There is nothing further to see. There is a
pleasant ramble of about two miles down to the sea.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;<i>Permission must be obtained of the prince, before leaving
Rome, to enter the woods.</i></p>

<p>Seven miles beyond Castel Fusano is Tor Paterno, the site of the
younger</p>

<h4>PLINY'S VILLA.</h4>

<p>"Seventeen miles from Rome; so that, having finished my affairs
in town, I can pass my evenings here without breaking in upon the
business of the day. There are two different roads to it: if you go
by that of Laurentum, you must turn off at the fourteenth mile; if
by Ostia, at the eleventh." (See Letter to Gallus, ii. 17.) Three
miles inland is Capocotta, the site of Laurentum, the capital of
Latium. Five miles off is Pratica, the ancient Lavinium, founded
by Æneas.

<hr class="l15" />

<p class="center"><span class="b12">ARCHÆOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL</span><br />

<span class="b15">PROMENADE LECTURES</span><br />

<span class="b13">ON THE ROMAN ANTIQUITIES,</span><br />

<span class="b12"><i>BY MR. S. RUSSELL FORBES, 93 VIA BABUINO</i>.</span></p>

<p>It is acknowledged by the <i>élite</i> of the British and American visitors to
Rome, that the only way to understand and enjoy the Antiquities of the
Eternal City is to attend the interesting and instructive Archæological and
Historical Lectures delivered on the spot by Mr. Forbes, whose long residence
and close study have qualified him to be an authority on the subject.</p>
<hr class="l05" />

<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"Mr. Forbes's long personal acquaintance with Rome gives him access to
sources of information which are beyond the reach of ordinary tourists, and
confer special value on his oral as well as printed explanations of the antiquities
of the city."&mdash;<i>Swiss Times.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Forbes has been a close student of Roman history, and for a period
of some sixteen years has been familiar with all the excavations and the developments
they have made. To be in his company and to hear his explanations
is therefore to reap many advantages which even the best informed
student of written history could not gain if left to himself."&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Russell Forbes is endowed with a thorough classical education and
great ability of research, and it is most delightful to be privileged to hear his
learned lectures, and while here to be conducted by him."&mdash;<i>Cleveland Herald.</i></p>

<p>"His explanations are remarkably clear and concise."&mdash;<i>Hartford Evening
Post.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Forbes has done most excellent and scholarly work upon the recent
excavations in demonstrating by the classics the exact location of ground
famous in the history of Rome; and though he often dissipates beyond hope
of revival popular conceptions, he always supplies a clear historical view."&mdash;<i>Boston
Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Russell Forbes's lectures are not merely dry, pedantic expounds of
history and art, but are truly most admirable, entertaining, and instructive
interpretations. Englishmen and Americans have always found Mr. Russell
Forbes's lectures one of the great pleasures in going to see our monuments,
and of special and uncommon advantage on their trips."&mdash;<i>Roman News.</i></p>

<p>"And what an explanation it was! No mere guide-book chatter, no parrot-like
repetition of an oft-told and wearisome story, but an intelligent conveying
of historical facts, evincing a genuine love for research, a profound admiration
for the work of the ancient days when Rome ruled the world, and a
deep regard for those trophies which the hand of time and the vandalism of
man have left to teach us the history of the past."&mdash;<i>Tourist Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="center b15">RAMBLES IN ROME.</p>

<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"All who mean to stay in the Eternal City should be provided with Mr.
S. Russell Forbes's 'Rambles in Rome.'"&mdash;<i>The Critic, New York.</i></p>

<p>"If you are visiting Rome you will find in this book a high-class companion
and guide. Try it, and see the difference between the mere guide-book
produced by the trade to sell, and the chatty, masterly production of a
writer of ability and taste."&mdash;<i>Sword and Trowel.</i></p>

<p>"It combines a great deal of out-of-the-way historical and archæological
knowledge, with a minute acquaintanceship with the ruins and other remains
of Rome."&mdash;<i>Glasgow News.</i></p>

<p>"An intelligently-written and well-arranged guide-book."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>"Copiously illustrated and well provided with maps and plans."&mdash;<i>Chelmsford
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"A compact and instructive book, which will be a most useful adjunct to
the traveller's knapsack."&mdash;<i>Life.</i></p>

<p>"Will undoubtedly prove a valuable hand-book to all who desire to see
and study the Rome of to-day in a systematic fashion."&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald.</i></p>

<p>"It is more than a guide-book; it is a book of reference, and should be in
every library."&mdash;<i>Newport (R. I.) News.</i></p>

<p>"It would be difficult to recommend a more serviceable volume."&mdash;<i>The
Italian Times.</i></p>

<p>"The guide is pleasant reading even by the fireside."&mdash;<i>American Register.</i></p>

<p>"Best, newest, and cheapest guide to Rome."&mdash;<i>The News.</i></p>

<p>"One great merit of Mr. Forbes's book is that he deals with his subject in
a business-like way. He briefly states what he knows about it, without indulging
in any rhapsodies or gushes of sentiment, or suggesting to his readers
what thoughts ought to surge up in their mind as they gaze upon any given
scenes or monuments."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>"The volume is profusely illustrated, and is incomparably the most valuable
guide to Rome and its antiquities."&mdash;<i>Christian Union.</i></p>

<p>"With its limp cover and pictures, it will be found a very handy pocket
volume to walk about with."&mdash;<i>The Guardian.</i></p>

<p>"It deserves commendation for two very conspicuous merits. It is the
work of an author who thoroughly understands his subject, and it is remarkably
direct and simple in style."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"The traveller or resident in the city will find the book of solid and constant
value."&mdash;<i>Boston Congregationalist.</i></p>

<p>"This is a very interesting work, by the well-known archæologist and
lecturer, Mr. Forbes, who gives the reader the benefit of his thorough knowledge
and familiarity with the subjects on which he writes. A stranger visiting
Rome, who desires to see, if not all, at least as many wonderful sights as
his time will permit, cannot do better than peruse Mr. Forbes's book, which
will enable him to see much more in a less time and with greater benefit to
himself than if he trusted to the guidance of some of the numerous cicerones
with which the Eternal City is infested."&mdash;<i>Travel.</i></p>

<p>"'Rambles in Rome' will prove a friend in need and indeed to all who
contemplate visiting the Eternal City."&mdash;<i>Musical Herald.</i></p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p class="center b15">The FOOTSTEPS of S. PAUL in ROME.</p>

<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. James Macgregor, writing from Edinburgh, says, "I read
last night for the first time, and have now lying before me, 'The Footsteps of
S. Paul in Rome.' Few books of late have given me more pleasure."</p>

<p>"We have also received a copy of 'Footsteps of S. Paul in Rome,' by the
same author, and can only speak of it in terms of the highest commendation."&mdash;<i>Travel.</i></p>

<p>"The work is very valuable. It is as true an account as probably will be
written of S. Paul's stay in Rome."&mdash;<i>Newport (R. I.) News.</i></p>

<p>Professor Francis W. Upham of New York says, "The essay is evidently
a labour of love&mdash;a model of patient thought and accurate investigation, and
of great interest and value."</p>

<p>"Full of interest, as being connected with Paul's everyday life, of which
but very little is known to the great mass of Christendom."&mdash;<i>Chelsea Telegraph.</i></p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p class="center b15">THE ROMAN CATACOMBS.</p>

<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"Mr. Russell Forbes has at last supplied a concise, practical, and original
illustrated handbook for the small price of two shillings. The object of his
historical manual is to tell the facts from personal study and exploration&mdash;biased
only for the truth."&mdash;<i>Roman News.</i></p>

<p>"Full of useful antiquarian lore, and suitably illustrated."&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p>

<p>"It is compact, well printed, and copiously illustrated with clear woodcuts."&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>"A great amount of lucid and well-arranged information about these curious
and interesting early Christian cemeteries."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>"The book is well illustrated, and is the only one that has ever appeared
in the English language giving facts drawn from a direct study on the spot."&mdash;<i>Travel.</i></p>

<p>"Very interesting and valuable. It has the decided advantage of being
written by one thoroughly conversant with the subjects he treats."&mdash;<i>American
Register.</i></p>

<hr class="l30" />
<p class="center b15">RAMBLES IN NAPLES.</p>

<p class="center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"This is another excellent guide by the author of 'Rambles in Rome;'
and is by far the most practical guide to Naples and its environs that has
been issued. Visitors will find in it all they want to know."&mdash;<i>Continental News.</i></p>

<p>"An indispensable <i>vade mecum</i>."&mdash;<i>Swiss Times.</i></p>

<p>"Described in a popular manner."&mdash;<i>Continental Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Useful and practical."&mdash;<i>American Register.</i></p>
